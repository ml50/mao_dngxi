00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.740
If we'd like to see a little more in detail what's going on with our tuning job,

00:00:04.740 --> 00:00:10.185
we can switch over to the Amazon SageMaker console and on the left-hand side,

00:00:10.185 --> 00:00:13.260
select Hyperparameter tuning jobs.

00:00:13.259 --> 00:00:15.419
You will see at the top here,

00:00:15.419 --> 00:00:17.535
that there is a tuning job in progress.

00:00:17.535 --> 00:00:21.269
This is the tuning job that we just created and it tells us

00:00:21.269 --> 00:00:25.379
the current progress in terms of the number of models that have been created.

00:00:25.379 --> 00:00:27.719
So far, zero models have been created out of

00:00:27.719 --> 00:00:30.734
the first three that are about to be created.

00:00:30.734 --> 00:00:32.744
If we click on this link,

00:00:32.744 --> 00:00:35.424
we can see all additional information.

00:00:35.424 --> 00:00:38.929
As the individual training jobs that are created are completed,

00:00:38.929 --> 00:00:41.539
they will form this list here and we can look at

00:00:41.539 --> 00:00:45.125
details corresponding to each of these specific tuning jobs,

00:00:45.125 --> 00:00:48.564
and in addition, as the tuning job progresses,

00:00:48.564 --> 00:00:52.250
we can take a look at the best training job to this point.

00:00:52.250 --> 00:00:55.460
Of course, currently we haven't completed any training job,

00:00:55.460 --> 00:00:56.719
so there is no best,

00:00:56.719 --> 00:00:59.089
and as one more piece of information that might be abused,

00:00:59.090 --> 00:01:02.000
we can take a look at the hyperparameter configuration and that

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:05.314
just provides us a nice summary of the tuning job that we created.

00:01:05.314 --> 00:01:07.009
Heading back to the notebook,

00:01:07.010 --> 00:01:10.270
we will wait for this tuning job to finish up.

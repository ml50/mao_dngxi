00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.970
In this lesson, we're going to take a look at how you can

00:00:02.970 --> 00:00:05.849
use SageMaker to create better tuned models.

00:00:05.849 --> 00:00:08.355
Often, when we're creating a model,

00:00:08.355 --> 00:00:10.620
we have to choose some hyperparameters.

00:00:10.619 --> 00:00:14.969
For example, you might need to choose the number of vertices in a tree,

00:00:14.970 --> 00:00:16.920
created by a random tree model.

00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:22.350
Or, you might choose the size of a hidden layer in a neural network.

00:00:22.350 --> 00:00:26.535
It would be nice if there was a way to test a whole bunch of hyperparameters,

00:00:26.535 --> 00:00:29.295
and then pick the best performing model.

00:00:29.295 --> 00:00:35.070
SageMaker provides a process for doing this called hyperparameter tuning.

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:39.359
Next, you're going to see how you can do this on your own models.

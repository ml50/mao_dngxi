00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.740
Now, that you've seen how to use sage makers hyperparameter tuning functionality,

00:00:04.740 --> 00:00:07.320
it's time to try it out for yourself.

00:00:07.320 --> 00:00:09.630
In the mini-projects folder,

00:00:09.630 --> 00:00:15.210
there is a notebook called IMDB Sentiment Analysis-XGBoost, hyperparameter tuning.

00:00:15.210 --> 00:00:19.380
In this notebook much like the other mini-project notebook,

00:00:19.379 --> 00:00:22.500
there isn't really much for you to do here except in step

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:26.699
four where instead of creating a single extra boost model,

00:00:26.699 --> 00:00:29.129
you will use decision-makers hyperparameter

00:00:29.129 --> 00:00:33.539
tuning functionality to train a bunch of different models and then pick the best one.

00:00:33.539 --> 00:00:35.445
To make things a little more interesting,

00:00:35.445 --> 00:00:37.774
somewhere in this notebook, there's an error.

00:00:37.774 --> 00:00:41.750
I would encourage you to just continue along throughout the notebook

00:00:41.750 --> 00:00:45.844
as if there is no error and when you do encounter a problem,

00:00:45.844 --> 00:00:49.359
try diagnosing it yourself using CloudWatch.

00:00:49.359 --> 00:00:50.564
If you get stuck,

00:00:50.564 --> 00:00:54.335
the solution notebook is also included and in the next video,

00:00:54.335 --> 00:00:56.329
we'll go through my solutions.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.860
Now that the tuning job has finished,

00:00:01.860 --> 00:00:04.710
you can see that we've got a whole bunch of output here.

00:00:04.710 --> 00:00:08.009
This output describes the results of our tuning Job,

00:00:08.009 --> 00:00:11.279
and one of the most important bits is all the way

00:00:11.279 --> 00:00:15.314
down here where it says best training job.

00:00:15.314 --> 00:00:19.108
You can see that this is an entry in the resulting dictionary

00:00:19.109 --> 00:00:23.280
which contains the name of the tuning job that performed the best.

00:00:23.280 --> 00:00:26.580
So, we're going to need that name so that we can create

00:00:26.579 --> 00:00:31.214
a model from the training artifacts associated with this training job.

00:00:31.214 --> 00:00:35.325
Now, if you don't want to go through this output and copy and paste,

00:00:35.325 --> 00:00:38.790
you can get a copy of this object by using

00:00:38.789 --> 00:00:43.994
the describe hyperparameter tuning job method of the SageMaker client.

00:00:43.994 --> 00:00:45.799
All you have to do is provide it with the name of

00:00:45.799 --> 00:00:47.959
the tuning job whose information you'd like to get.

00:00:47.960 --> 00:00:51.785
Now, tuning job info contains all of the information up here.

00:00:51.784 --> 00:00:55.949
In particular, it has the name of the best training job.

00:00:55.950 --> 00:01:00.609
Using that name, we can use the describe training job method,

00:01:00.609 --> 00:01:03.170
to get information about that training job.

00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:07.640
In particular, we can get access to the model artifacts which are stored on S3.

00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:11.599
Once we have a URI to the Model Artifacts,

00:01:11.599 --> 00:01:14.269
we can use that to construct a model object.

00:01:14.269 --> 00:01:15.875
Remember then in SageMaker,

00:01:15.875 --> 00:01:21.125
a model is a collection of data that contains the container that is meant to be used

00:01:21.125 --> 00:01:26.359
during inference in addition to the model artifacts that were created during training.

00:01:26.359 --> 00:01:28.804
Once we've created the model object,

00:01:28.805 --> 00:01:32.330
we can create a batch transform job to test our model.

00:01:32.329 --> 00:01:33.920
To create a batch transform job,

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:37.189
we do the same thing as we did in the previous notebook.

00:01:37.189 --> 00:01:40.849
In that we just create a data structure that it contains

00:01:40.849 --> 00:01:45.034
all the information about the batch transform job we wish to create,

00:01:45.034 --> 00:01:48.649
and then we ask SageMaker to execute that batch transform

00:01:48.650 --> 00:01:53.165
job and wait for the results to see how well our model is doing.

00:01:53.165 --> 00:01:55.775
Now that the batch transform job has finished up,

00:01:55.775 --> 00:01:57.560
we can copy the results to

00:01:57.560 --> 00:02:02.250
our notebook instance and then take a look and see how well it did.

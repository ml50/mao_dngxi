00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.889
Here's my complete estimator.

00:00:01.889 --> 00:00:03.990
I passed in the usual role,

00:00:03.990 --> 00:00:07.155
sage_maker session and train_instance details.

00:00:07.155 --> 00:00:09.810
I also created an output path in S3,

00:00:09.810 --> 00:00:12.225
where I can save the trained model attributes.

00:00:12.224 --> 00:00:15.464
I pass in the image name specific to deep AR.

00:00:15.464 --> 00:00:17.925
So this estimator knows what model to train.

00:00:17.925 --> 00:00:21.330
Now this only gives me a pretty basic estimator and I'm

00:00:21.329 --> 00:00:24.869
going to want to define hyperparameters for the deep AR model.

00:00:24.870 --> 00:00:28.560
I wanted to find parameters like the number of epochs to train for,

00:00:28.559 --> 00:00:30.570
and the prediction and contexts length that I

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:33.119
want the model to sample from the training data.

00:00:33.119 --> 00:00:37.399
I also have to let it know that my time series and lengths are measured in days.

00:00:37.399 --> 00:00:39.545
These are just the required parameters.

00:00:39.545 --> 00:00:42.320
There are a lot more optional parameters that can define

00:00:42.320 --> 00:00:45.920
the underlying recurrent neural network in the training behavior.

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:48.109
So here I've provided a good starting list for

00:00:48.109 --> 00:00:51.609
those parameters and a link here to read more about each one.

00:00:51.609 --> 00:00:56.689
Basically, the number of cells and layers define the size of the underlying RNN,

00:00:56.689 --> 00:01:01.039
and a bigger size is able to capture more complex relationships in the data.

00:01:01.039 --> 00:01:05.120
Then batch size and learning rate define how this model trains and improves.

00:01:05.120 --> 00:01:09.770
Then in this cell, I'm passing in those hyperparameters and setting them to my estimator.

00:01:09.769 --> 00:01:14.405
Finally, I can pass in my training and test data and fit this estimator.

00:01:14.405 --> 00:01:16.835
Now I could only provide training data.

00:01:16.834 --> 00:01:19.824
But we've created both training and test data.

00:01:19.825 --> 00:01:23.135
A test data set means that deep AR can calculate

00:01:23.135 --> 00:01:27.515
accuracy metrics for the model during training on this test data set.

00:01:27.515 --> 00:01:30.469
The computed error metrics will be included as part of

00:01:30.469 --> 00:01:33.679
the log output that we can monitor for a training job.

00:01:33.680 --> 00:01:37.910
So next, I'll call fit and I'll deploy this trained model.

00:01:37.909 --> 00:01:40.144
After creating a prediction endpoint,

00:01:40.144 --> 00:01:45.599
next I'll show you how we can make some predictions and evaluate this trained model.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.480
Now you've gotten a lot of practice with sage maker.

00:00:03.480 --> 00:00:05.405
In this last deployment lesson,

00:00:05.405 --> 00:00:09.005
you'll look at one more application; time series forecasting.

00:00:09.005 --> 00:00:11.550
An example of a time series is something like

00:00:11.550 --> 00:00:14.935
the temperature of a place measured every hour over a day,

00:00:14.935 --> 00:00:18.285
or the price of stocks as they rise and fall over time.

00:00:18.285 --> 00:00:20.850
Time series forecasting is all about looking at

00:00:20.850 --> 00:00:24.285
historical data and using it to try to predict the future.

00:00:24.285 --> 00:00:26.550
In this lesson, we'll specifically talk about

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:29.685
choosing a context length and a prediction length.

00:00:29.684 --> 00:00:32.299
The context length defines the amount of data

00:00:32.299 --> 00:00:35.750
recorded in the past that an algorithm will see as input.

00:00:35.750 --> 00:00:39.484
For example, we could give a model a month's worth of weather data.

00:00:39.484 --> 00:00:44.119
Then ask it to use that data to form a prediction over some length of time,

00:00:44.119 --> 00:00:46.684
like predicting the weather for the next week.

00:00:46.685 --> 00:00:48.200
During the training process,

00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:53.145
we'll actually compare the predicted output to some known real data in that time frame.

00:00:53.145 --> 00:00:54.710
So we do have a target.

00:00:54.710 --> 00:00:56.209
Now as an example,

00:00:56.209 --> 00:00:58.955
say you know that it's been sunny for an hour today.

00:00:58.954 --> 00:01:00.695
This is your context.

00:01:00.695 --> 00:01:03.799
What do you think the weather will be like in the next hour?

00:01:03.799 --> 00:01:07.355
Well, it might be a good prediction to say that it will still be sunny.

00:01:07.355 --> 00:01:10.560
But what if I asked you to predict the weather for next week,

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:13.365
given only this one sunny hour for context?

00:01:13.364 --> 00:01:15.140
That becomes much harder.

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:19.015
You don't have enough context to know what a typical week of weather looks like.

00:01:19.015 --> 00:01:21.500
Generally, the more contexts you're given,

00:01:21.500 --> 00:01:25.010
the more you'll be able to notice about patterns and data over time.

00:01:25.010 --> 00:01:29.030
So a longer context length will often result in better predictions.

00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:33.140
Conversely, your predicted output values become more uncertain over time.

00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:37.609
Next, you'll learn about different strategies for approaching time series analysis.

00:01:37.609 --> 00:01:41.314
You'll go from data exploration to model deployment and sage maker.

00:01:41.314 --> 00:01:42.829
By the end of this lesson,

00:01:42.829 --> 00:01:45.349
you'll be able to employ similar strategies to

00:01:45.349 --> 00:01:48.839
analyze any time series data that interest you.

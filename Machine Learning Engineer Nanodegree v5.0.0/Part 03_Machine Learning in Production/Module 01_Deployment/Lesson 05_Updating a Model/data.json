There are many reasons for wanting to do this, the two that we will look at are, performing an A/B test and updating a model which is no longer performing as well.\n\nTo start, we will look at performing an A/B test between two different models. Then, once we've decided on a model to use, updating the existing endpoint so that it only sends data to a single model.\n\nFor the second example, it may be the case that once we've built a model and begun using it, the assumptions on which our model is built begin to change.\n\nFor instance, in the sentiment analysis examples that we've looked at our models are based on a vocabulary consisting of the 5000 most frequently appearing words in the training set. But what happens if, over time, the usage of words changes? Then our model may not be as accurate.\n\nWhen this happens we may need to modify our model, often this means re-training it. When we do, we'd like to update the existing endpoint without having to shut it down. Fortunately, SageMaker allows us to do this in a straightforward way.",

In the example we are working on here we construct a linear learner model as an alternative to the previously created XGBoost model.\n\n**Note:** It is important to notice that the result returned by the linear learner model is json, compared to the csv data returned by the XGBoost model.

These features include the following.\n\n * **Notebook Instances** provide a convenient place to process and explore data in addition to making it very easy to interact with the rest of SageMaker's features.\n\n * **Training Jobs** allow us to create *model artifacts* by fitting various machine learning models to data.\n\n * **Hyperparameter Tuning** allow us to create multiple training jobs each with different hyperparameters in order to find the hyperparameters that work best for a given problem.\n\n * **Models** are essentially a combination of *model artifacts* formed during a training job and an associated docker container (code) that is used to perform inference.\n\n * **Endpoint Configurations** act as blueprints for endpoints. They describe what sort of resources should be used when an endpoint is constructed along with which models should be used and, if multiple models are to be used, how the incoming data should be split up among the various models.\n\n * **Endpoints** are the actual HTTP URLs that are created by SageMaker and which have properties specified by their associated endpoint configurations. **Have you shut down your endpoints?**\n\n * **Batch Transform** is the method by which you can perform inference on a whole bunch of data at once. In contrast, setting up an endpoint allows you to perform inference on small amounts of data by sending it do the endpoint bit by bit.\n\nIn addition to the features provided by SageMaker we used three other Amazon services.\n\nIn particular, we used **S3** as a central repository in which to store our data. This included test / training / validation data as well as model artifacts that we created during training.\n\nWe also looked at how we could combine a deployed SageMaker endpoint with **Lambda** and **API Gateway** to create our own simple web app.",

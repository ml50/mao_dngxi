Instances Required for Deep Learning\n<Explain which instances we need and why there is a need for 3 different types of instances (cost, GPU acceleration, algorithm support)  and when we need them in the ND>\n\nThe table below describes the three types of SageMaker instances that you would use in this course:\n\n| SageMaker Instance | vCPU | GPU | Mem (GiB) | GPU Mem (GiB)\t | Network Performance | Usage | Default Quota (Limit)|\n| ------------- |:-------------:|:-------------:|:-------------:|:-------------:|:-------------:|:-------------:|:-------------:|\n| `ml.t2.medium`     | 2 | - | 4| - | Low to Moderate | Run notebooks | 0 - 20  |\n| `ml.m4.xlarge`     | 4 | - | 16 | - | High | <ul><li>Train and batch transform XGBOOST models; </li><li>Deploy all models preceding the first project</li></ul>  | 0 - 20 |\n| `ml.p2.xlarge`     | 4 | 1xK80 | 61 | 12 | High | Train and batch transform GPU accelerated Pytorch models for the first project | 0 -1 |\n\nIn this course, the `ml.m4.xlarge` is needed at an early stage, while `ml.p2.xlarge` is needed only when working on the for the first project: Deploying a Sentiment Analysis Model.  \n\n>### <font color=\"red\"> Note \nSagemaker quotas, also referred to as limits, are very tricky. Every AWS user does not get the default quotas for SageMaker instances, which is why the last column shows a range, e.g., 0 - 20. The **Default Quota** depends on the instance type, the task you want to run (see table above), and also the region in which the Sagemaker service is requested.

AWS Service Utilization Quota (Limits)\nYou need to understand the way AWS imposes ***utilization quotas*** (limits) on almost all of its services. *Quotas*, also referred to as *limits*, are the maximum number of resources of a particular service that you can create in your AWS account. \n* AWS provides default quotas, **for each AWS service.**\n* Importantly, **each quota is region-specific.** \n* There are three ways to **view your quotas**, as mentioned [here](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/aws_service_limits.html): \n 1. Service Endpoints and Quotas, \n 2. Service Quotas console, and \n 3. AWS CLI commands - `list-service-quotas` and `list-aws-default-service-quotas` \n* In general, there are three ways to **increase the quotas**:\n 1. Using [*Amazon Service Quotas*](https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2019/06/introducing-service-quotas-view-and-manage-quotas-for-aws-services-from-one-location/) service - This service consolidates your account-specific values for quotas across all AWS services for improved manageability. Service Quotas is available at no additional charge. You can directly try logging into [Service Quotas console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/servicequotas/home) here. \n 2. Using [*AWS Support Center*](https://console.aws.amazon.com/support/home) - You can create a case for support from AWS.\n 3. AWS CLI commands -   `request-service-quota-increase` \n\n### A.1. Amazon SageMaker Utilization Quota (Limits)\nYou can view the *Amazon SageMaker Service Limits* at [\"Amazon SageMaker Endpoints and Quotas\"](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/sagemaker.html) page. You can request to increase the AWS Sagemaker quota using the [*AWS Support Center*](https://console.aws.amazon.com/support/home) only. Note that <font color=\"red\"> currently the *Amazon Service Quotas* does not support SageMaker service.</font> However, SageMaker would be introduced soon into Service Quotas.

The `upload_data` function should be close to the top of the list! You'll also see functions like `train`, `tune`, and `create_model` all of which we'll go over in more detail, later.\n* **Role** - Sometimes called the _execution role_, this is the IAM role that you created when you created your notebook instance. The role basically defines how data that your notebook uses/creates will be stored. You can even try printing out the role with `print(role)` to see the details of this creation.\n",

In these instances, we'll be using S3 buckets for data storage. \n\n> S3 is a virtual storage solution that is mostly meant for data to be written to few times and read from many times. This is, in some sense, the main workhorse for data storage and transfer when using Amazon services. These are similar to file folders that contain data _and_ metadata about that data, such as the data size, date of upload, author, and so on.\n\n**S3** stands for Simple Storage Service (S3).\n\nAfter you upload data to a session, you should see that an S3 bucket is created, as indicated by an output like the following:\n```python\nINFO: sagemaker: Created S3 bucket: <message specific to your locale, ex. sagemaker-us-west-1-#>\n```\n\nIf you'd like to learn more about how we're creating a csv file, you can check out [the pandas documentation](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/generated/pandas.concat.html).

In particular, we will be using the [XGBoost](https://xgboost.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) algorithm. The details of XGBoost are beyond the scope of this module as we are interested in learning about SageMaker. If you would like to learn more about XGBoost I would recommend starting with the documentation which you can find at https://xgboost.readthedocs.io/en/latest/\n\nThe notebook we will be working though in this video and in the following two videos can be found in the `Tutorial` directory and is called `Boston Housing - XGBoost (Batch Transform) - High Level.ipynb`. Now that you know why **Boston Housing** and **XGBoost** are in the name, let's talk a bit about the rest of it.\n\nFirst, **Batch Transform** is the method we will be using to test our model once we have trained it. This is something that we will discuss a little more later on.\n\nSecond, **High Level** describes the API we will be using to get SageMaker to perform various machine learning tasks. In particular, it refers to the Python SDK whose documentation can be found here: https://sagemaker.readthedocs.io/en/latest/. This high level approach simplifies a lot of the details when working with SageMaker and can be very useful.",

A location on S3 where your training (and possibly validation) data is stored,\n2. A location on S3 where the resulting model will be stored (this data is called the model artifacts),\n3. A location of a docker container (certainly this is the case if using a built in algorithm) to be used for training\n4. A description of the compute instance that should be used.\n\nOnce you provide all of this information, SageMaker will executed the necessary instance (CPU or GPU), load up the necessary docker container and execute it, passing in the location of the training data. Then when the container has finished training the model, the _model artifacts_ are packaged up and stored on S3.\n\nYou can see a high-level (which we've just walked through) example of training a KMeans estimator, [in this documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/latest/dg/ex1-train-model-create-training-job.html). This high-level example defines a KMeans estimator, and uses `.fit()` to train that model. Later, we'll show you a low-level model, in which you have to specify many more details about the training job.\n\n",

Moving forward, most of the mini-projects that you will complete throughout this module will use the IMDB dataset.\n\n**Note:** For the most part, creating this XGBoost model is pretty similar to the Boston Housing example that we just looked at so you can look there if you get stuck.

For the most part, this comprises two very important pieces.\n\nThe first is the container that holds the model inference functionality. For different types of models this code may be different but for simpler models and models provided by Amazon this is typically the same container that was used to train the model.\n\nThe second is the model artifacts. These are the pieces of data that were created during the training process. For example, if we were fitting a linear model then the coefficients that were fit would be saved as model artifacts.",

When this code is executed, it is provided access to the training (and possibly validation) data stored on S3.\n\nOnce the compute instance has finished fitting the model, the resulting model artifacts are stored on S3 and the compute instance is shut down.",

This means making a model available for other entities to use. Along the way we will create a simple web app that interacts with a deployed model.\n\nIn addition, we will look at hyperparameter tuning. Which is a way to train a bunch of different models, all with different hyperparameters, and then select the one that performs the best.\n\nLastly, we will take a look at updating a deployed model. Sometimes a model may not work as well as it once did due to changes in the underlying data. In [this resource](https://edouardfouche.com/Data-Stream-Generation-with-Concept-Drift/), you can read more about how a model's predictions and accuracy may degrade as a result of something called *concept drift*, which is a change in the underlying data distribution over time. When this happens we might want to update a deployed model, however, our model may be in use so we don't want to shut it down. SageMaker allows us to solve this problem without there being any loss of service.",

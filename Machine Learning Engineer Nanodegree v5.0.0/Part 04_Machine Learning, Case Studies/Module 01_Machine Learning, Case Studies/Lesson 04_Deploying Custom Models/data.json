As you follow along with this lesson, you should work in the referenced SageMaker notebooks. We will present a solution to you, but please try to work on a solution of your own, when prompted. Much of the value in this experience will come from experimenting with the code, **in your own way**. \n\nTo open this notebook:\n>- Navigate to your SageMaker notebook instance, in the [SageMaker console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/), which has been linked to the main [Github exercise repository](https://github.com/udacity/ML_SageMaker_Studies)\n- Activate the notebook instance (if it is in a \"Stopped\" state), and open it via Jupyter\n- Click on the exercise notebook in the `Moon_Data` directory.\n\nYou may also directly view the exercise and solution notebooks via the repository at the following links:\n* [Exercise notebook](https://github.com/udacity/ML_SageMaker_Studies/blob/master/Moon_Data/Moon_Classification_Exercise.ipynb)\n* [Solution notebook](https://github.com/udacity/ML_SageMaker_Studies/blob/master/Moon_Data/Moon_Classification_Solution.ipynb)\n\nIn this particular case, you will also find a directory `source` and `source_solution` for further reference.\n\n**The solutions are meant to be consulted if you are stuck or want to check your work.**\n\n## Notebook Outline\n\nWe'll go over the following steps to complete the notebook.\n\n* Upload data to S3\n* Define a PyTorch neural network for binary classification\n* Write a custom **training script**\n* Train and evaluate the custom model\n\n## Later: Delete Resources\n\nAt the end of this exercise, and intermittently, you will be reminded to delete your endpoints and resources so that you do not incur any extra processing or storage fees!",

This script should also save the trained model parameters.\n* A **predict** script that defines how a trained model produces an output and in what format.\n\n## PyTorch\n\nIn PyTorch, you have the option of defining a neural network of your own design. These models do not come with any built-in predict scripts and so you have to write one yourself.\n\n## SKLearn\n\nThe `scikit-learn` library, on the other hand, has many pre-defined models that come with train and predict functions attached!\n\nYou can define custom SKLearn models in a very similar way that you do PyTorch models only you typically **only** have to define the training script.

              "text": "# Create and Deploy a Trained Model\n\nBefore you can deploy a custom PyTorch model, you have to take one more step: creating a `PyTorchModel`. In earlier exercises, you could see that a call to `.deploy()` created **both** a *model* and an *endpoint*, but for PyTorch models, these steps have to be separate. PyTorch models do not automatically come with `.predict()` functions attached (as many Amazon and Scikit-learn models do, for example) and you may have noticed that you've been given a `predict.py` file in the `source` directory. This file is responsible for loading a trained model and applying it to passed in, numpy data. \n\nNow, when we created a PyTorch **estimator**, we specified where the training script, `train.py` was located. And we'll have to do something very similar here, but for a PyTorch **model** and the `predict.py` file. \n\n### EXERCISE: Instantiate a PyTorchModel\nYou can create a `PyTorchModel` from your trained, estimator attributes. This model is responsible for knowing how to execute a specific `predict.py` script. And this model is what you'll deploy to create an endpoint.\n\n#### Model Parameters\nTo instantiate a `PyTorchModel`, ([documentation, here](https://sagemaker.readthedocs.io/en/stable/sagemaker.pytorch.html#pytorch-model)) you pass in the same arguments as your PyTorch estimator, with a few additions/modifications:\n\n* **model_data**: The trained model.tar.gz file created by your estimator, which can be accessed as estimator.model_data.\n* **entry_point**: This time, this is the path to the Python script SageMaker runs for prediction rather than training, predict.py.\n\nIn the exercise notebook, you've been given the following code to fill in:\n\n```python\n%%time\n# importing PyTorchModel\nfrom sagemaker.pytorch import PyTorchModel\n\n# Create a model from the trained estimator data\n# And point to the prediction script\nmodel = None\n```\n\n### EXERCISE: Deploy the trained model\nDeploy your model to create a predictor. We'll use this to make predictions on our test data and evaluate the model.\n\n```python\n%%time\n# deploy and create a predictor\npredictor = None\n```\n\n\n### Evaluate your Model\n\nAfter deploying your model, you have been given some code to evaluate its performance according to a variety of metrics!\n\n> Remember to **delete your predictor endpoint** *after* you've finished evaluating the model. \n\nTry to complete these steps on your own, and I'll go over one solution, next!\n",

We’ll also utilize a number of SageMaker’s built-in algorithms.\n\n---",

In our case, we’ll focus on three different problems and look at how they can be solved using various machine learning strategies. The case studies are as follows:\n\n>**Case Study 1 - Population Segmentation using SageMaker**\n\nYou’ll look at a portion of [US census data](https://www.census.gov/data.html) and, using a combination of unsupervised learning methods, extract meaningful components from that data and group regions by similar census-recorded characteristics. This case study will be a deep dive into Principal Components Analysis (PCA) and K-Means clustering methods, and the end result will be groupings that are used to inform things like localized marketing campaigns and voter campaign strategies.\n",

The payment transaction dataset we'll work with is unbalanced, with many more examples of valid transactions vs. fraudulent, and so you will investigate methods for compensating for this imbalance and tuning your model to improve its performance according to a specific product goal.\n\n>**Custom Models - Non-Linear Classification**\n\nAdding on to what you have learned in the credit card fraud case study, you will learn how to manage cases where classes of data are not separable by a linear line. You'll train and deploy a custom, PyTorch neural network for classifying data.\n\n>**Case Study 3 - Time-Series Forecasting**\n\nThis case demonstrates how to train SageMaker's DeepAR model for forecasting predictions over time. Time-series forecasting is an active area of research because a good forecasting algorithm often takes in a number of different features and accounts for seasonal or repetitive patterns. In this study, you will learn a bit about creating features out of time series data and formatting it for training.\n",

To review, the k-means clustering algorithm can be broken down into a few steps; the following steps assume that you have n-dimensional data, which is to say, data with a discrete number of features associated with it. In the case of housing price data, these features include traits like house size, location, etc. **features** are just measurable components of a data point. K-means works as follows:\n\nYou select `k`, a predetermined number of clusters that you want to form. Then `k` points (centroids for k clusters) are selected at random locations in feature space.\nFor each point in your training dataset:\n1. You find the centroid that the point is closest to\n2. And assign that point to that cluster\n3. Then, for each cluster centroid, you move that point such that it is in the center of _all_ the points that are were assigned to that cluster in step 2.\n4. Repeat steps 2 and 3 until you’ve either reached convergence and points no longer change cluster membership _or_ until some specified number of iterations have been reached.\n\nThis algorithm can be applied to any kind of unlabelled data. You can watch a video explanation of the k-means algorithm, as applied to color image segmentation, below. In this case, the k-means algorithm looks at R, G, and B values as features, and uses those features to cluster individual pixels in an image!",

It is good practice to be specific about two additional parameters:\n* **output_path (str)** – S3 location for saving the training result (model artifacts and output files). If not specified, results are stored to a default bucket.\n* **sagemaker_session (sagemaker.session.Session)** – Session object which manages interactions with Amazon SageMaker APIs and any other AWS services needed.\n\n## Model-Specific Parameters\n\nYou'll also notice a parameter `k` for the number of clusters this model should produce as output.

You can approximate this separation by measuring how close your data points are to each cluster center; the average centroid distance between cluster points and a centroid. After trying several values for k, the centroid distance typically reaches some \"elbow\"; it stops decreasing at a sharp rate and this indicates a good value of k. \n\nThe graph below indicates the average distance—between our component data and cluster centroids—for a value of k between 5 and 12.",

By combining PCA and k-means, and the information contained in the model attributes within a SageMaker trained model, you can learn about a population and remark on some patterns you've found, based on the data.\n\nTo access the k-means model attributes, you'll find the following guidance in the main, exercise notebook.\n\n### EXERCISE: Access the k-means model attributes\nExtract the k-means model attributes from where they are saved as a TAR file in an S3 bucket.\n\nYou'll need to access the model by the k-means training job name, and then unzip the file into model_algo-1. Then you can load that file using MXNet, as before.\n\n```python\n# download and unzip the kmeans model file\n# use the name model_algo-1\n\n```\n\n```python\n# get the trained kmeans params using mxnet\nkmeans_model_params = None\n\nprint(kmeans_model_params)\n```\n\nSave the model attributes as `kmeans_model_params`; you should see that there is only 1 set of model parameters contained within the k-means model: the **cluster centroid locations** in PCA-transformed, component space.\n\n### Cluster Centroids\n\nYou know that each of the counties in our US county data, is assigned to a cluster and that indicates something about groupings found by k-means and similarities between counties in the same cluster. But, what exactly _are_ the features that these clusters have in common? \n\n>For example, how is cluster 1 any different than cluster 2?\n\nThis is what we aim to define by looking at the location of cluster centroids in component space. Since each cluster is defined in component space, we can look at how eighty each component is in defining a certain cluster. Then, we can go one step further and map the components back to the original data features. I encourage you to look at the visualization code in the exercise notebook and watch the next video to see some complete code.",

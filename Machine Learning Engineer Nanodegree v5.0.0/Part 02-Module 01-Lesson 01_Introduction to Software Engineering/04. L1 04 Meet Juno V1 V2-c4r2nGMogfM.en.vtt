00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.740
I want to tell you about two experiences that demonstrate how

00:00:04.740 --> 00:00:09.780
software engineering has always been an essential tool in my data science work.

00:00:09.779 --> 00:00:13.619
My first experience is about my previous job,

00:00:13.619 --> 00:00:17.125
where I've worked as a data scientist at a small startup.

00:00:17.125 --> 00:00:21.899
There, my work involved several machine learning and deep learning projects,

00:00:21.899 --> 00:00:24.329
where personalized shopping experiences for

00:00:24.329 --> 00:00:28.034
users and built analytic tools for the business.

00:00:28.035 --> 00:00:33.299
Although I was excited that my work touched on many different areas in data science,

00:00:33.299 --> 00:00:38.765
one unexpected part was how much software engineering I learned and applied.

00:00:38.765 --> 00:00:42.689
Almost everyone else was more of a software engineer,

00:00:42.689 --> 00:00:47.445
with roles ranging from web and mobile developer to systems architect.

00:00:47.445 --> 00:00:52.355
To implement my data science ideas and bring them to production,

00:00:52.354 --> 00:00:57.589
I had to use the proper practices and tools used in software development.

00:00:57.590 --> 00:01:02.585
Applying these practices, really allowed me to collaborate effectively with

00:01:02.585 --> 00:01:08.195
other developers and set up my data science code to work well in production.

00:01:08.194 --> 00:01:11.324
Since this specific job was at a startup,

00:01:11.325 --> 00:01:15.025
I did get more involved in the software engineering side of things,

00:01:15.025 --> 00:01:17.310
than I would at a larger company.

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:19.495
But like we mentioned earlier,

00:01:19.495 --> 00:01:22.010
there are significant benefits to using

00:01:22.010 --> 00:01:26.950
software engineering practices as a data scientist in any context.

00:01:26.950 --> 00:01:32.064
This leads me to my second experience about my first major project.

00:01:32.064 --> 00:01:35.295
Before even landing my first data science job,

00:01:35.295 --> 00:01:40.894
there used to be a calendar app that I organized my life with and loved.

00:01:40.894 --> 00:01:44.474
When I heard it was being taken down from the App Store,

00:01:44.474 --> 00:01:46.984
I decided to build my own version.

00:01:46.984 --> 00:01:50.269
I wanted to take it a step further and build

00:01:50.269 --> 00:01:54.250
the chatbot that would automatically create calendar entries for me,

00:01:54.250 --> 00:01:57.370
and answer questions I had about my schedule.

00:01:57.370 --> 00:02:00.605
I used my data science skills to create

00:02:00.605 --> 00:02:05.715
a chatbot that classified messages and generated appropriate responses.

00:02:05.715 --> 00:02:08.664
But I didn't know anything about web development,

00:02:08.664 --> 00:02:10.539
and wasn't sure where to start.

00:02:10.539 --> 00:02:13.840
So, I took an online course in web development.

00:02:13.840 --> 00:02:16.729
I figured out how to build a web app that

00:02:16.729 --> 00:02:20.560
integrated with the chatbot and Google calendar's API,

00:02:20.560 --> 00:02:23.335
and set up servers to host it online.

00:02:23.335 --> 00:02:29.120
In the end, I needed both data science skills and software engineering skills,

00:02:29.120 --> 00:02:30.900
to build my calendar app.

00:02:30.900 --> 00:02:33.890
But it was worth it because I was able to bring

00:02:33.889 --> 00:02:38.354
my vision to reality with this powerful combination of skills.

00:02:38.354 --> 00:02:41.989
It can seem intimidating to start learning about

00:02:41.990 --> 00:02:46.105
software engineering and how to apply it to your data science work,

00:02:46.104 --> 00:02:47.879
but that's why we're here,

00:02:47.879 --> 00:02:49.359
to walk you through it.

00:02:49.360 --> 00:02:55.110
I gained valuable knowledge and skills with resources online and on the job,

00:02:55.110 --> 00:02:56.970
and I know you can too.

00:02:56.969 --> 00:03:02.000
Andrew and I will be showing you some of the tricks we've learned so that

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:07.759
you can start incorporating useful software engineering practices as a data scientist.

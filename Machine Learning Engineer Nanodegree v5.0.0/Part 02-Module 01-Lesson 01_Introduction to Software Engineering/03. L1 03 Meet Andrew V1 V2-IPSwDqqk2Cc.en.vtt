Hi, I'm a content developer here at Udacity.

00:00:03.629 --> 00:00:07.084
I previously worked on the Self-Driving Car Nanodegree program.

00:00:07.084 --> 00:00:09.960
I have a bachelor's degree in mechanical engineering.

00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:12.180
You might ask yourself why someone who

00:00:12.179 --> 00:00:15.050
studied engineering would be teaching data science?

00:00:15.050 --> 00:00:20.745
Well, my interest in data came after college when I spent a year studying in Peru.

00:00:20.745 --> 00:00:24.679
While I was there, I started a jewelry business with the Peruvian friend.

00:00:24.679 --> 00:00:26.609
At first, it was just the two of us,

00:00:26.609 --> 00:00:29.679
the jeweler and me, the engineer.

00:00:29.679 --> 00:00:33.310
I think you can guess which one of us became the jewelry designer,

00:00:33.310 --> 00:00:36.030
and which one had to learn Web development,

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:38.175
data analysis, and machine learning.

00:00:38.174 --> 00:00:42.854
To give a couple of examples of how we've used data science and analysis,

00:00:42.854 --> 00:00:46.769
I made a linear regression model that helps us price new designs.

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:51.960
I've also analyzed web traffic and keyword searches to make content better.

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:53.640
Over the span of one year,

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:58.355
I increased unique monthly visitors from 1,000 to 12,000,

00:00:58.354 --> 00:01:01.209
and that's without spending anything on marketing.

00:01:01.210 --> 00:01:06.799
I learned to code and analyze data the exact same way you are doing right now,

00:01:06.799 --> 00:01:10.795
by taking online classes and then making awesome projects.

00:01:10.795 --> 00:01:12.480
I'm proof that someone with

00:01:12.480 --> 00:01:16.760
a noncomputer science background can still be a proficient programmer.

Hi. Welcome to this course on software engineering. I'm Juno.

00:00:09.554 --> 00:00:14.080
I'm Andrew and we are very excited to be guiding you through this course.

00:00:14.080 --> 00:00:18.780
Wait. Juno, why are we talking about software engineering?

00:00:18.780 --> 00:00:23.635
You told me that I was here to teach a course for the Data Scientist Nanodegree program.

00:00:23.635 --> 00:00:29.775
Okay. I admit data scientists and software engineers have quite different roles.

00:00:29.774 --> 00:00:35.164
Data scientists are like the researchers or thinkers who explore and model data.

00:00:35.164 --> 00:00:38.784
For data scientists, code is a means to an end.

00:00:38.784 --> 00:00:40.559
On the other hand,

00:00:40.560 --> 00:00:43.370
software engineers are like the builders and

00:00:43.369 --> 00:00:47.909
well engineers who make products and write code for production.

00:00:47.909 --> 00:00:50.899
Software engineers need to write efficient,

00:00:50.899 --> 00:00:53.379
robust, and maintainable code.

00:00:53.380 --> 00:00:58.770
But, both data scientists and software engineers code and write programs.

00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:02.155
I think I see where you're going with this.

00:01:02.155 --> 00:01:04.540
We as data scientists write a lot of code,

00:01:04.540 --> 00:01:10.475
but we don't always pay attention to things like code structure and maintainability.

00:01:10.474 --> 00:01:13.099
For example, a good software engineer spends

00:01:13.099 --> 00:01:16.149
the time to write clean and well-tested code.

00:01:16.150 --> 00:01:18.865
We have a thing or two to learn from them.

00:01:18.864 --> 00:01:21.479
Yes. As a data scientist,

00:01:21.480 --> 00:01:26.510
you most likely be working in teams and share code across your organization.

00:01:26.510 --> 00:01:29.750
Your insights could influence important business decisions

00:01:29.750 --> 00:01:33.594
or you may be building models to use in their product.

00:01:33.594 --> 00:01:35.929
This makes it crucial that you follow

00:01:35.930 --> 00:01:41.300
a few software engineering practices that ensure your code is clean and reliable.

00:01:41.299 --> 00:01:44.469
You'll improve the efficiency of your workflow,

00:01:44.469 --> 00:01:49.174
collaboration in teams, and communication with software developers.

00:01:49.174 --> 00:01:52.789
It's true. Software engineering skills will help you

00:01:52.790 --> 00:01:56.750
stand out against the competition when applying for data science positions.

00:01:56.750 --> 00:01:59.495
Employers want and often expect

00:01:59.495 --> 00:02:03.280
good software engineering skills from their data scientists.

00:02:03.280 --> 00:02:06.170
I'm glad I convinced you because we've got

00:02:06.170 --> 00:02:09.275
some awesome projects and exercises in this course.

00:02:09.275 --> 00:02:14.498
By the end, you will have applied a number of useful software engineering practices,

00:02:14.498 --> 00:02:16.289
built a Python package,

00:02:16.289 --> 00:02:18.509
and created a Web application.

00:02:18.509 --> 00:02:21.719
Let's take a closer look at what you'll be building.

00:00:04.190 --> 00:00:08.005
We've divided this course into three parts.

00:00:08.005 --> 00:00:12.515
The first part is a review of general software engineering practices,

00:00:12.515 --> 00:00:15.964
like using version control and documenting your code.

00:00:15.964 --> 00:00:17.565
In the second part,

00:00:17.565 --> 00:00:22.440
you're going to build your own Python package using object oriented programming.

00:00:22.440 --> 00:00:27.625
If you've ever wondered how pandas or the scikit-learn packages work under the hood,

00:00:27.625 --> 00:00:29.835
that's what this lesson is all about.

00:00:29.835 --> 00:00:34.515
Finally, the last part will be an introduction to web development.

00:00:34.515 --> 00:00:40.375
You're going to build a data visualization web app that you can put online and share.

00:00:40.375 --> 00:00:42.104
In all of these lessons,

00:00:42.104 --> 00:00:46.279
you will gain practical skills and produce a couple of applications

00:00:46.280 --> 00:00:51.030
that you can customize and use as a part of your professional portfolio.

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:54.645
But before diving into software engineering practices,

00:00:54.645 --> 00:00:57.840
we want to tell you a bit about our experiences.

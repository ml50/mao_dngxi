00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.285
In this lesson, you built a credit card detection model and improved it over time.

00:00:06.285 --> 00:00:09.810
Many of the best developers and researchers I know,

00:00:09.810 --> 00:00:12.495
not only looked for solutions to problems,

00:00:12.494 --> 00:00:14.820
but they look for the best solutions.

00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:20.160
That often means looking at how a machine learning model fits into a larger picture.

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:22.679
The best models consider a variety of

00:00:22.679 --> 00:00:26.399
metrics and the experience of someone using the model.

00:00:26.399 --> 00:00:28.814
In this fraud detection example,

00:00:28.814 --> 00:00:34.484
you saw how to train machine learning model and aim for a certain level of recall.

00:00:34.484 --> 00:00:37.994
SageMaker gives you a simple way to tune models

00:00:37.994 --> 00:00:41.954
based on the constraints that you give it during your training process.

00:00:41.954 --> 00:00:46.820
You also learned one approach to dealing with class imbalance in your data.

00:00:46.820 --> 00:00:49.880
Real data is messy and often imbalanced.

00:00:49.880 --> 00:00:53.780
It takes the work of data scientists using tools like augmentation,

00:00:53.780 --> 00:00:57.859
imbalancing techniques to make meaning of this kind of data.

00:00:57.859 --> 00:01:04.140
Take these learnings with you as you get to the next and final lesson in this section.

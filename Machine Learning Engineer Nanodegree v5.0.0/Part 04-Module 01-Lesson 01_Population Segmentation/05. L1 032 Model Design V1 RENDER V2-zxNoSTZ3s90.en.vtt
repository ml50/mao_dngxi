00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.370
Now, let's talk a little bit about model design and algorithms selection.

00:00:05.370 --> 00:00:08.280
Choosing an unsupervised or supervised approach,

00:00:08.279 --> 00:00:10.500
has a lot to do with your end goal.

00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:16.094
Unsupervised learning is often most useful when your end goal is relatively simple.

00:00:16.094 --> 00:00:20.634
For example, when you only want to group similar observations,

00:00:20.635 --> 00:00:25.395
you don't need a lot of detail about each individual observation.

00:00:25.394 --> 00:00:28.500
To group vehicles into cars, bikes,

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:32.740
and buses, you probably don't need the specific car model.

00:00:32.740 --> 00:00:38.250
Alternatively, say you've been asked to distinguish between different models of cars,

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:41.715
like images of a Tesla versus Toyota Prius,

00:00:41.715 --> 00:00:45.740
then you may actually want to go the extra step of labeling

00:00:45.740 --> 00:00:51.020
your vehicle image data so that you can train a specific classification model.

00:00:51.020 --> 00:00:53.030
If you have a lot of unlabeled data,

00:00:53.030 --> 00:00:58.039
you may be wondering how can I efficiently and accurately label this data?

00:00:58.039 --> 00:01:02.439
Data labeling is unfortunately a human intensive task.

00:01:02.439 --> 00:01:07.819
Ideally, you'd want to send your raw images to people who can manually draw

00:01:07.819 --> 00:01:10.354
bounding boxes around different car models

00:01:10.355 --> 00:01:14.075
as recognizing car models is a problem you are solving.

00:01:14.075 --> 00:01:16.820
You may also think of ways to automate

00:01:16.819 --> 00:01:21.379
your data labeling task with the help of what is called an active learning model,

00:01:21.379 --> 00:01:26.034
which is the machine learning model that can learn from human initial annotations.

00:01:26.034 --> 00:01:32.194
SageMaker combines these two capabilities are these two approaches sending the data to

00:01:32.194 --> 00:01:35.119
real humans and creating an active learning model for

00:01:35.120 --> 00:01:38.410
future tasks into one feature called ground truth.

00:01:38.409 --> 00:01:44.584
Ground truth, tries to solve the problem of going from raw data to label training data.

00:01:44.584 --> 00:01:48.379
It allows you to first send some of your data to be labeled

00:01:48.379 --> 00:01:51.890
by humans then having gotten this initial labels,

00:01:51.890 --> 00:01:54.019
it trains a machine learning model that

00:01:54.019 --> 00:01:57.274
learns to automate this labeling task in a future.

00:01:57.275 --> 00:02:00.440
Overall, these reduces the time and cost to label

00:02:00.439 --> 00:02:04.679
similar datasets in the future by about 70 percent.

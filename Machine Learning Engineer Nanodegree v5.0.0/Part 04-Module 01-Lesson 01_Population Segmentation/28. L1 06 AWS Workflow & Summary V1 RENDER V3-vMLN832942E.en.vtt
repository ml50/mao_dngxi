00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.669
You've really learned a lot in this lesson,

00:00:02.669 --> 00:00:07.799
going from approaching unstructured tasks like population segmentation,

00:00:07.799 --> 00:00:11.894
to creating features and deploying a k-means clustering model.

00:00:11.894 --> 00:00:15.119
Congratulations. The steps you took to deploy

00:00:15.119 --> 00:00:20.579
your segmentation model are steps you can use when approaching any other task.

00:00:20.579 --> 00:00:24.704
In our industry, often the most challenging step is the first one,

00:00:24.704 --> 00:00:28.589
figuring out what business question you want to answer.

00:00:28.589 --> 00:00:31.259
In this lesson, we gave you an example,

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:34.590
which US counties have similar characteristics,

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:37.925
and what kinds of features defined that similarity?

00:00:37.924 --> 00:00:41.449
Not all questions need machine learning to be answered.

00:00:41.450 --> 00:00:43.130
But for those that do,

00:00:43.130 --> 00:00:46.085
you will need to collect and prepare relevant data.

00:00:46.085 --> 00:00:49.685
This step can take quite a lot of time and resources.

00:00:49.685 --> 00:00:53.855
It's also good practice to explore this data and see if there's

00:00:53.854 --> 00:00:58.609
anything notable about the distribution of the data or the different features.

00:00:58.609 --> 00:01:02.479
Once you have data that is ready to be fed into a model,

00:01:02.479 --> 00:01:04.834
you need to host that data somewhere.

00:01:04.834 --> 00:01:09.769
You can do this on your laptop by creating a notebook and saving your data locally,

00:01:09.769 --> 00:01:13.399
this is useful when exploring a small portion of your data.

00:01:13.400 --> 00:01:15.109
But for large datasets,

00:01:15.109 --> 00:01:20.420
you may want to upload those directly into a cloud storage such as Amazon S3.

00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:24.799
SageMaker allows you to spin up a notebook instance where you have

00:01:24.799 --> 00:01:29.704
the option of uploading and managing large datasets using an S3 bucket.

00:01:29.704 --> 00:01:33.424
In this lesson, you work with two different models.

00:01:33.424 --> 00:01:39.920
You train and deploy a principal component analysis model to simplify population data.

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:42.890
This technique discards some information into

00:01:42.890 --> 00:01:46.909
raw data and create a few meaningful features,

00:01:46.909 --> 00:01:51.545
then you use these features to train a k-means clustering model.

00:01:51.545 --> 00:01:57.379
After training, you are able to evaluate the model by looking at the modal attributes.

00:01:57.379 --> 00:02:03.769
Finally, deployment gave you the ability to assign any data points to a certain cluster,

00:02:03.769 --> 00:02:07.418
and you could see which US counties were grouped together,

00:02:07.418 --> 00:02:10.699
and what kinds of features they shared in common.

00:02:10.699 --> 00:02:14.704
You did all of this from data cleaning to

00:02:14.705 --> 00:02:18.969
model deployment within a SageMaker notebook instance.

00:02:18.969 --> 00:02:20.984
In the next few lessons,

00:02:20.985 --> 00:02:23.750
we'll look at more real-world tasks.

00:02:23.750 --> 00:02:27.740
You'll be tasked with some supervised learning problems in which you can choose to

00:02:27.740 --> 00:02:31.790
use built-in algorithms or custom models of your own.

00:02:31.789 --> 00:02:35.849
So I hope you're excited to learn even more.

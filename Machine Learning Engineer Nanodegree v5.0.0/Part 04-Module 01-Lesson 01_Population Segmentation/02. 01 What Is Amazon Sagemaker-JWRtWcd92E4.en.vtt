00:00:04.879 --> 00:00:09.809
Welcome. Today, I'm interviewing Dan Mbanga. , from Amazon AI.

00:00:09.810 --> 00:00:12.150
He work on business and technical issues at

00:00:12.150 --> 00:00:14.880
Amazon including things like Amazon's SageMaker.

00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:17.775
That's what I want to talk to you today about.

00:00:17.774 --> 00:00:19.875
So just to start,

00:00:19.875 --> 00:00:22.065
we all have a working definition.

00:00:22.065 --> 00:00:26.495
How do you describe Amazon SageMaker to someone who's working with machine learning?

00:00:26.495 --> 00:00:27.880
Yeah. Thank you, Cezanne.

00:00:27.879 --> 00:00:30.989
Amazon SageMaker is an end-to-end Machine Learning Service.

00:00:30.989 --> 00:00:35.159
Essentially, it solves the problem of building,

00:00:35.159 --> 00:00:38.764
training, tuning, and deploying machine learning algorithms.

00:00:38.765 --> 00:00:42.493
If you think about our story at Amazon,

00:00:42.493 --> 00:00:47.865
where we do have that by internal and external customers.

00:00:47.865 --> 00:00:49.370
I was at Amazon Web Services.

00:00:49.369 --> 00:00:51.409
We worked within total Amazon companies.

00:00:51.409 --> 00:00:56.414
There are building products for E-commerce or other services like Alexa,

00:00:56.414 --> 00:00:59.030
there's a lot of machine learning involved there.

00:00:59.030 --> 00:01:04.114
There are thousands and thousands of data scientists and AI engineers around the world.

00:01:04.114 --> 00:01:07.054
Building and training machine learning platform that scale.

00:01:07.055 --> 00:01:10.040
So we had that challenge of scaling machine learning,

00:01:10.040 --> 00:01:12.730
making it accessible to multiple developers,

00:01:12.730 --> 00:01:15.760
getting to understand the workflow of machine learning,

00:01:15.760 --> 00:01:17.270
and then training people,

00:01:17.269 --> 00:01:18.679
and building tools around

00:01:18.680 --> 00:01:22.060
that workflow to make sure that we ease the process of eventually,

00:01:22.060 --> 00:01:23.855
building products with machine learning.

00:01:23.855 --> 00:01:25.730
So gathering that experience,

00:01:25.730 --> 00:01:29.180
we basically decided to create Amazon SageMaker,

00:01:29.180 --> 00:01:31.490
which essentially follows developers and

00:01:31.489 --> 00:01:34.949
data scientists through the end-to-end process of building,

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:38.159
training, and tuning machine learning algorithms.

00:01:38.159 --> 00:01:39.849
If you think about that process,

00:01:39.849 --> 00:01:42.169
you have to think about collecting data.

00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:49.079
You have to think about an environment where people have to crunch the data,

00:01:49.079 --> 00:01:51.679
look at the data distribution, analyze the data,

00:01:51.680 --> 00:01:55.655
and do the whole statistical approach of looking at dataset.

00:01:55.655 --> 00:02:00.019
That environment needs to be organized in such a way that it has tools that

00:02:00.019 --> 00:02:04.129
are enabling these data scientists to essentially get that work done.

00:02:04.129 --> 00:02:06.799
The third thing they need to do is to scale

00:02:06.799 --> 00:02:10.609
the process potentially of training these algorithms on large dataset.

00:02:10.610 --> 00:02:15.680
Then there's a very strong infrastructural orchestration need from

00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:18.765
that perspective and the other that needs to happen

00:02:18.764 --> 00:02:22.789
is figuring out where the models are eventually going to leave.

00:02:22.789 --> 00:02:26.479
Either in a real application or on a device,

00:02:26.479 --> 00:02:30.019
and all of these design and orchestration decisions have

00:02:30.020 --> 00:02:34.835
to traditionally be the responsibility of the scientists and developers.

00:02:34.835 --> 00:02:37.939
SageMaker takes some of that responsibility away,

00:02:37.939 --> 00:02:41.539
the undifferentiated heavy lifting essentially and make sure

00:02:41.539 --> 00:02:45.634
that data scientists and developers can focus on data science,

00:02:45.634 --> 00:02:51.599
and the infrastructure and orchestration piece of the work is done by the platform.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.394
Your first case study will be to analyze US census data.

00:00:04.394 --> 00:00:07.679
The census is a big survey that includes information about

00:00:07.679 --> 00:00:11.054
the demographic makeup of various regions in the US.

00:00:11.054 --> 00:00:15.029
One of its main purposes is to count up the population of each state.

00:00:15.029 --> 00:00:18.570
That number is used to determine congressional apportionment.

00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:21.539
But data like this has a variety of applications.

00:00:21.539 --> 00:00:23.609
The census includes information like

00:00:23.609 --> 00:00:26.655
the most prominent age range in certain areas of the US,

00:00:26.655 --> 00:00:28.859
the rate of unemployment, and so on.

00:00:28.859 --> 00:00:32.909
You can imagine using this information to create localized marketing campaigns,

00:00:32.909 --> 00:00:38.299
informed campaign strategies, and generally to learn more about certain areas in the US.

00:00:38.299 --> 00:00:39.804
In this lesson, you'll use

00:00:39.804 --> 00:00:43.615
a SageMaker notebook instance to load in and process this data.

00:00:43.615 --> 00:00:45.024
When you explore the data,

00:00:45.024 --> 00:00:47.390
you'll see that it's just tables of information.

00:00:47.390 --> 00:00:50.314
It doesn't contain any class labels to aim for.

00:00:50.314 --> 00:00:54.379
So you'll employ unsupervised learning techniques to group this data.

00:00:54.380 --> 00:00:57.679
Unsupervised algorithms allow us to ask what are

00:00:57.679 --> 00:01:01.250
the natural groupings that I can find in this population data,

00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:05.450
and which features are most effective at distinguishing these different groups?

00:01:05.450 --> 00:01:08.000
Your end goal will be to produce groupings that reveal

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:11.840
some similarities and differences between regions in the US,

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:15.365
segmenting the population based on shared demographic traits.

00:01:15.364 --> 00:01:18.140
This is called population segmentation.

00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:20.704
We'll approach this task step-by-step.

00:01:20.704 --> 00:01:22.219
First, I'll be going over

00:01:22.219 --> 00:01:26.215
an exercise notebook that demonstrates loading in and processing data.

00:01:26.215 --> 00:01:29.465
Then, I'll show you how to deploy an unsupervised model.

00:01:29.465 --> 00:01:33.695
Intermittently, you'll get a chance to practice what you've learned in code exercises.

00:01:33.694 --> 00:01:35.689
You'll define population features,

00:01:35.689 --> 00:01:39.509
and learn how to train and deploy an unsupervised model.

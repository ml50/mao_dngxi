00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.980
The first thing you'll want to do is get

00:00:01.980 --> 00:00:04.679
access to the notebooks that we'll be using in this lesson.

00:00:04.679 --> 00:00:06.359
I'm assuming that you've gone through this process

00:00:06.360 --> 00:00:09.240
before and already have an AWS account.

00:00:09.240 --> 00:00:12.300
So I've already logged into my AWS console here.

00:00:12.300 --> 00:00:14.280
I'll just quickly go through getting to

00:00:14.279 --> 00:00:17.324
the SageMaker console and creating a notebook instance.

00:00:17.324 --> 00:00:18.719
It never hurts to practice,

00:00:18.719 --> 00:00:21.570
and this dashboard occasionally changes in appearance.

00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:24.600
So this is what it looks like as I'm going through this exercise.

00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:28.395
I've logged into my personal AWS account, and I have my region,

00:00:28.394 --> 00:00:30.434
which is in Northern California,

00:00:30.434 --> 00:00:32.655
and you should set this for yourself as well.

00:00:32.655 --> 00:00:35.210
Then I want to get to Amazon SageMaker,

00:00:35.210 --> 00:00:37.189
and I can just search for it by name.

00:00:37.189 --> 00:00:39.439
So here's the SageMaker dashboard.

00:00:39.439 --> 00:00:43.789
You can see a lot of buttons on the side that point to things like notebook instances,

00:00:43.789 --> 00:00:46.789
training jobs, as well as things like models and end points,

00:00:46.789 --> 00:00:49.939
which will be useful for monitoring how our models train later.

00:00:49.939 --> 00:00:52.655
For now I want to actually create a new notebook instance.

00:00:52.655 --> 00:00:54.050
So I'm going to click on this button.

00:00:54.049 --> 00:00:57.589
Now I actually have a couple of notebooks that I'm in the middle of working with,

00:00:57.590 --> 00:01:00.615
but it's okay if this is blank or looks a bit different for you.

00:01:00.615 --> 00:01:03.304
We'll be working with a completely new notebook anyways.

00:01:03.304 --> 00:01:05.420
So to create a new notebook I'm going to click

00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:08.060
this button up here, Create notebook instance.

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:09.769
You should see this pop-up,

00:01:09.769 --> 00:01:12.469
a place to specify in my notebook instance settings.

00:01:12.469 --> 00:01:14.879
First I need to add a name for my notebook.

00:01:14.879 --> 00:01:18.634
You can call this whatever you like and only mean something descriptive,

00:01:18.635 --> 00:01:20.605
like ML case studies.

00:01:20.605 --> 00:01:22.450
For many of the rest of these values,

00:01:22.450 --> 00:01:24.439
you can leave them as the default value.

00:01:24.439 --> 00:01:28.519
For example the instance type is ml.t2 medium,

00:01:28.519 --> 00:01:33.094
which is a CPU instance that's going to be ideal for a development environment.

00:01:33.094 --> 00:01:35.439
Next there's the IAM role.

00:01:35.439 --> 00:01:38.054
In small print, you can see a description of this role.

00:01:38.055 --> 00:01:40.970
It says, Choose a role or let us create a role with

00:01:40.969 --> 00:01:44.989
the AmazonSageMakerFullAccess IAM policy attached.

00:01:44.989 --> 00:01:48.079
This role defines the permissions that your notebook has,

00:01:48.079 --> 00:01:50.149
like what data it can read or write,

00:01:50.150 --> 00:01:55.565
and a full access role will give us access to all the public data-sets in S3 for example.

00:01:55.564 --> 00:01:58.715
I'd suggest you click this and select Create a new role.

00:01:58.715 --> 00:02:00.305
Here you can see that by default,

00:02:00.305 --> 00:02:03.695
you have access to any S3 bucket with SageMaker in the name,

00:02:03.694 --> 00:02:06.169
and we can also specify any additional buckets.

00:02:06.170 --> 00:02:08.344
But for these examples, we won't have any.

00:02:08.344 --> 00:02:13.000
So you can select None here and then click Create role to complete a new role.

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:14.789
Okay, so we have an instance name,

00:02:14.789 --> 00:02:18.275
we have a type, and we have a new role that we just created.

00:02:18.275 --> 00:02:20.480
Now for VPC, life cycle,

00:02:20.479 --> 00:02:21.979
encryption and volume size,

00:02:21.979 --> 00:02:24.169
you can leave these as the default values.

00:02:24.169 --> 00:02:26.914
Now you could create an empty notebook instance right now.

00:02:26.914 --> 00:02:29.644
But we'll actually want to link this to a Git repository,

00:02:29.645 --> 00:02:32.105
and we can do that with this tab here.

00:02:32.104 --> 00:02:36.219
I want to link this notebook to a public Git repository.

00:02:36.219 --> 00:02:39.430
Specifically, I want to clone the lesson notebooks that are in

00:02:39.430 --> 00:02:43.240
a Udacity public repository called ML SageMaker Studies,

00:02:43.240 --> 00:02:44.765
and I can link to it by name.

00:02:44.764 --> 00:02:47.959
This repository holds examples for a bunch of lessons,

00:02:47.960 --> 00:02:52.400
and so I just need to create this one notebook instance to work through all of them.

00:02:52.400 --> 00:02:56.780
The last thing I need to do is just click Create notebook instance.

00:02:56.780 --> 00:02:59.890
Then you should get back to this main notebook instance page,

00:02:59.889 --> 00:03:04.264
and you should see that your notebook is in pending status.

00:03:04.264 --> 00:03:07.234
I actually deleted one of my older notebooks

00:03:07.235 --> 00:03:09.785
to make room for this new ML case studies one.

00:03:09.784 --> 00:03:12.409
It may take a moment for this to become in service,

00:03:12.409 --> 00:03:16.719
but once it does, you can select to open it in Jupyter or Jupyter lab.

00:03:16.719 --> 00:03:19.159
I find Jupyter lab to be most helpful when you're

00:03:19.159 --> 00:03:21.590
moving back and forth between files often,

00:03:21.590 --> 00:03:23.555
as you might in larger projects.

00:03:23.555 --> 00:03:25.205
But for these example notebooks,

00:03:25.205 --> 00:03:26.785
I'm just going to work in Jupyter.

00:03:26.784 --> 00:03:30.049
When you open this notebook instance you should see all files

00:03:30.050 --> 00:03:33.725
that were in the GitHub repository for ML SageMaker studies.

00:03:33.724 --> 00:03:36.739
These are all the lessons and examples that we'll be going through.

00:03:36.740 --> 00:03:41.120
I suggest you create a notebook instance of your own and have that open in one tab,

00:03:41.120 --> 00:03:42.545
while going through these lessons,

00:03:42.544 --> 00:03:45.989
that way you can alternate between learning and applying what you've learned.

00:03:45.990 --> 00:03:49.985
For the first lesson I'll be working with the population segmentation directory.

00:03:49.985 --> 00:03:54.770
Tasks and exercises are presented to you in the pop segmentation exercise notebook.

00:03:54.770 --> 00:03:57.860
If you need a place to consult a final solution,

00:03:57.860 --> 00:03:59.555
you can look at the solution notebook.

00:03:59.555 --> 00:04:01.129
So to work through this lesson,

00:04:01.129 --> 00:04:03.049
I'm going to click on this exercise notebook.

00:04:03.050 --> 00:04:05.780
All right. Next, I'll go over the task of

00:04:05.780 --> 00:04:08.390
population segmentation and start loading and

00:04:08.389 --> 00:04:12.479
exploring the data we'll be working with in this exercise notebook.

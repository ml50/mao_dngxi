Hello, welcome to this lesson on deployment.

00:00:02.865 --> 00:00:04.110
I'm Suzanne Kumacho.

00:00:04.110 --> 00:00:06.615
I teach deep learning concepts here at Udacity.

00:00:06.615 --> 00:00:10.440
Today I'm happy to have with me a deployment expert, Dan Lubanga.

00:00:10.439 --> 00:00:12.419
Could you tell us a bit about what you do Dan?

00:00:12.419 --> 00:00:14.550
Yes, and thank you Suzanne.

00:00:14.550 --> 00:00:18.825
I lead Amazon AI Business Development efforts for machine learning services.

00:00:18.824 --> 00:00:20.294
On a day-to-day basis,

00:00:20.295 --> 00:00:24.540
I work with our customers from startups to large enterprises to ensure

00:00:24.539 --> 00:00:26.579
that they do successfully build and deploy

00:00:26.579 --> 00:00:29.174
their machine learning models on Amazon SageMaker.

00:00:29.175 --> 00:00:32.505
So far we've been talking a lot about machine learning models,

00:00:32.505 --> 00:00:33.554
and in this lesson,

00:00:33.554 --> 00:00:38.909
we'll talk about deploying trained models using cloud services like Amazon SageMaker.

00:00:38.909 --> 00:00:42.449
I'll talk about the capabilities of SageMaker and

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:45.920
Suzanne will lead you through practical code implementations.

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:48.800
Getting comfortable with deployment as with anything,

00:00:48.799 --> 00:00:50.479
is really all about practice.

00:00:50.479 --> 00:00:54.694
So we'll give you some insights into how to use SageMaker and it's built-in tools,

00:00:54.695 --> 00:00:59.670
and challenge you to solve a variety of tasks along the way. Let's get started.

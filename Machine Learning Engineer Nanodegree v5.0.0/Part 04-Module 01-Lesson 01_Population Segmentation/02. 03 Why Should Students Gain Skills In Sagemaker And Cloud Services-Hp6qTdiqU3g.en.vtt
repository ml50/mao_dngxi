00:00:02.180 --> 00:00:04.349
A lot of word,

00:00:04.349 --> 00:00:06.389
I've been focusing on when I teach Machine Learning,

00:00:06.389 --> 00:00:07.889
as you know training,

00:00:07.889 --> 00:00:09.269
and defining these models.

00:00:09.269 --> 00:00:10.980
But there's a big other piece,

00:00:10.980 --> 00:00:12.870
and I hear a lot from industry professionals,

00:00:12.869 --> 00:00:16.619
that building is probably the smallest piece of these technologies,

00:00:16.620 --> 00:00:19.019
like the biggest part is really, maintaining,

00:00:19.019 --> 00:00:23.024
updating in the face of gathering new data.

00:00:23.024 --> 00:00:28.784
So I was wondering if you could speak to what makes Sagemaker and Cloud services,

00:00:28.785 --> 00:00:31.664
a good skill to have career right,

00:00:31.664 --> 00:00:34.560
why is for people who are looking to become machine learning engineer's.

00:00:34.560 --> 00:00:36.840
Okay, let's follow through

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:40.080
the process of building a machine learning product for example.

00:00:40.079 --> 00:00:42.795
As you know that involves big data,

00:00:42.795 --> 00:00:44.385
that involves handling data,

00:00:44.384 --> 00:00:48.349
that involves getting from understanding business problem,

00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:51.530
and mapping that business problem to machine learning problem,

00:00:51.530 --> 00:00:55.719
that's already a skill that you are teaching in the program.

00:00:55.719 --> 00:00:57.679
The other thing that people need to do,

00:00:57.679 --> 00:01:00.189
is to get into collecting the right amount of data,

00:01:00.189 --> 00:01:03.019
that would relate to solve that machine learning problem.

00:01:03.020 --> 00:01:05.040
So there is a data collection,

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:08.280
organization, and analysis component to do there.

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:12.480
Then the next thing that developers and data scientists need to do,

00:01:12.480 --> 00:01:17.380
is to jump in the process of selecting a machine learning algorithm,

00:01:17.379 --> 00:01:20.750
building and training machine learning model from that algorithm,

00:01:20.750 --> 00:01:24.230
and invalidating that machine learning model against some metrics,

00:01:24.230 --> 00:01:25.549
that could be accuracy,

00:01:25.549 --> 00:01:27.825
that can be cause, that can be time,

00:01:27.825 --> 00:01:32.585
and many other parameters that are potentially used to the business.

00:01:32.584 --> 00:01:35.539
Then if they have a satisfactory machine learning model

00:01:35.540 --> 00:01:37.375
based on the metrics that they have,

00:01:37.375 --> 00:01:39.540
then they can put that in production.

00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:41.550
If they don't have a satisfactory model,

00:01:41.549 --> 00:01:44.509
then it goes back in the process of collecting the data,

00:01:44.510 --> 00:01:46.745
or selecting different algorithms.

00:01:46.745 --> 00:01:51.340
So if you think about that entire end to end process of machine learning,

00:01:51.340 --> 00:01:55.070
as learners are going through the process of learning

00:01:55.069 --> 00:01:58.819
how to apply that process to the data,

00:01:58.819 --> 00:02:01.579
companies are also going through the process

00:02:01.579 --> 00:02:05.064
of automating that machine learning life-cycle.

00:02:05.064 --> 00:02:06.480
So there's synergy there,

00:02:06.480 --> 00:02:07.935
where as a learner,

00:02:07.935 --> 00:02:11.569
it's very important for you to get acquainted with a tool

00:02:11.569 --> 00:02:15.530
that can teach you the best practices involved in that process,

00:02:15.530 --> 00:02:16.865
and Sagemaker does that.

00:02:16.865 --> 00:02:20.685
Sagemaker would facilitate the process of collecting data,

00:02:20.685 --> 00:02:23.569
and in the platform will essentially instruct you

00:02:23.569 --> 00:02:27.079
as what are the best ways to look at data labeling practices,

00:02:27.080 --> 00:02:31.565
and then understand how to handle over the data to a machine learning algorithm or model.

00:02:31.564 --> 00:02:35.180
Then when it comes to training machine learning algorithms at scale,

00:02:35.180 --> 00:02:41.210
the platform is designed with APIs and all other related automation,

00:02:41.210 --> 00:02:45.120
to essentially create clusters,

00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:50.094
apply hyper-parameter optimization in some cases to the algorithms, such as training,

00:02:50.094 --> 00:02:55.090
and give you some validation metrics for you to look at,

00:02:55.090 --> 00:03:00.520
whether your machine learning algorithm was a successful trained algorithm or not.

00:03:00.520 --> 00:03:03.820
Then the next thing that is possible to do with the platform is,

00:03:03.819 --> 00:03:06.849
automate the deployment of the machine learning model in production.

00:03:06.849 --> 00:03:09.579
So again, following the process of

00:03:09.580 --> 00:03:12.865
building and training and deploying machine-learning algorithms.

00:03:12.865 --> 00:03:15.865
So if you get into that mindset,

00:03:15.865 --> 00:03:19.210
you stand much more like a higher probability of

00:03:19.210 --> 00:03:22.540
being successful in an interview with an employer,

00:03:22.539 --> 00:03:23.840
that is interested in machine learning,

00:03:23.840 --> 00:03:26.780
because they are going through the exact same process.

00:03:26.780 --> 00:03:30.650
Yeah, the great thing about machine learning is that,

00:03:30.650 --> 00:03:34.625
these algorithms improve over time with more data and more examples.

00:03:34.625 --> 00:03:36.580
When do you think about developing a product,

00:03:36.580 --> 00:03:38.270
it's very different than something that's

00:03:38.270 --> 00:03:41.420
just a physical thing that you get someone has done,

00:03:41.419 --> 00:03:45.569
is something that you want to be able to go through this cycle of gathering data,

00:03:45.569 --> 00:03:49.250
improving your algorithm, I think it can be the best thing to your consumers.

00:03:49.250 --> 00:03:52.685
So really thinking about that whole cycle,

00:03:52.685 --> 00:03:54.620
when you're a part of a team,

00:03:54.620 --> 00:03:56.349
or an engineer who's in charge of all of that,

00:03:56.349 --> 00:03:57.469
it is really important.

00:03:57.469 --> 00:04:01.330
So I'm excited to be partner with you and teach all these things.

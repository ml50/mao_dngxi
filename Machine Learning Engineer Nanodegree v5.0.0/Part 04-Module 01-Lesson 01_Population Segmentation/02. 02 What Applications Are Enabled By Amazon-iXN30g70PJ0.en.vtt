00:00:02.839 --> 00:00:06.629
So one of the things you mentioned is scale and products

00:00:06.629 --> 00:00:09.570
at scale and I was wondering if you have some applications

00:00:09.570 --> 00:00:14.250
that you find the most interesting that are really enabled by these things

00:00:14.250 --> 00:00:16.725
that SageMaker makes available whether it's data management

00:00:16.725 --> 00:00:19.770
or deploying to a huge number of customers

00:00:19.769 --> 00:00:25.035
Yes. There are two ways we can think about scale.

00:00:25.035 --> 00:00:30.410
Like one on the explosion of data that exists out there.

00:00:30.410 --> 00:00:33.409
Now, if you think about social networks,

00:00:33.409 --> 00:00:35.719
if you think about using devices that are

00:00:35.719 --> 00:00:38.320
internet-connected that are generating a lot of data.

00:00:38.320 --> 00:00:41.899
So mainly applications that can include chatbots,

00:00:41.899 --> 00:00:43.954
that can include social networks.

00:00:43.954 --> 00:00:49.549
Applications really have the massive opportunity to deal with a lot of data

00:00:49.549 --> 00:00:53.359
and use that amount of data with

00:00:53.359 --> 00:00:57.649
machine learning algorithms got help understand end-users better,

00:00:57.649 --> 00:01:03.119
that help get to better decisions as far as potentially recommending products,

00:01:03.119 --> 00:01:04.640
for example, to these end-users.

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:09.739
So we see a lot of applications in the world of the mobile development or Internet

00:01:09.739 --> 00:01:12.439
of Things where large and large amounts

00:01:12.439 --> 00:01:15.304
of data are passed through machine-learning algorithms.

00:01:15.305 --> 00:01:21.955
We also see a lot of applications in sports analytics where you have NFL, for example,

00:01:21.954 --> 00:01:28.968
using machine learning algorithms on platforms like SageMaker to transform the experience

00:01:28.968 --> 00:01:32.469
that end-users have or consumers

00:01:32.469 --> 00:01:36.289
have in front of their TV with the benefits of machine learning.

00:01:36.290 --> 00:01:37.100
I didn't think about that.

00:01:37.099 --> 00:01:39.634
Yeah. In Formula One, for example,

00:01:39.635 --> 00:01:45.725
does live analytics and then uses machine learning models in the back-end

00:01:45.724 --> 00:01:49.069
to do some early predictions and then pass that and

00:01:49.069 --> 00:01:52.579
rebroadcast that experience back to the users on a TV.

00:01:52.579 --> 00:01:57.094
So if you think about the stream of data that goes from the cars that are racing,

00:01:57.094 --> 00:02:02.075
all the way up to the cloud and the expectation to pass the insights

00:02:02.075 --> 00:02:07.430
in real-time or in near real-time back to the users that are watching the show,

00:02:07.430 --> 00:02:09.409
it's pretty incredible the amount of data that

00:02:09.409 --> 00:02:12.539
goes through the life cycle of machine learning.

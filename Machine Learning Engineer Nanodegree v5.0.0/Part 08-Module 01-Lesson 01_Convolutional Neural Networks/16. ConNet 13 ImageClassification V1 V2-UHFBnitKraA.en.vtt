00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.410
So far, you've learned a lot about approaching the task of image classification.

00:00:04.410 --> 00:00:08.710
In fact, now is a good time to review the pipeline we've developed for such a task.

00:00:08.710 --> 00:00:12.060
First, load and visualize the data you're working with,

00:00:12.060 --> 00:00:16.170
then pre-process that data by normalizing it and converting it into a tensor,

00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:20.070
so that it's prepped for further processing by the layers of a neural network.

00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:21.804
Then, do your research,

00:00:21.804 --> 00:00:24.644
has anyone approached this or similar task before?

00:00:24.644 --> 00:00:28.019
What kind of deep learning models have already been tried and tested?

00:00:28.019 --> 00:00:32.200
Use this research to help you decide on a model architecture and define it.

00:00:32.200 --> 00:00:36.695
Then, decide on loss and optimization functions and proceed with training your model.

00:00:36.695 --> 00:00:39.465
Here, you may choose to use a validation dataset

00:00:39.465 --> 00:00:42.410
to select and save the best model during training.

00:00:42.409 --> 00:00:45.929
Finally, test your model on previously unseen data.

00:00:45.929 --> 00:00:49.024
At this point, feel free to take a break from what you are learning,

00:00:49.024 --> 00:00:51.530
take time to absorb what you've learned so far.

00:00:51.530 --> 00:00:53.765
Then when you're ready, you can keep going.

00:00:53.765 --> 00:00:57.560
Next, I'll go over a new kind of architecture for image classification,

00:00:57.560 --> 00:00:59.289
a convolutional neural network,

00:00:59.289 --> 00:01:02.640
which can help us build even better image classification models.

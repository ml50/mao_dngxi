00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.915
So far you've seen how to create two kinds of neural networks for image classification,

00:00:04.915 --> 00:00:07.424
and you've seen how convolutional neural networks

00:00:07.424 --> 00:00:10.320
follow a series of steps to classify an image.

00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:13.530
Just to recap, a CNN first takes in an input image,

00:00:13.529 --> 00:00:17.024
then puts that image through several convolutional and pooling layers.

00:00:17.024 --> 00:00:21.509
The result is a set of feature maps reduced in size from the original image that

00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:23.460
through a training process have learned to distill

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:26.304
information about the content in the original image.

00:00:26.304 --> 00:00:27.945
We then flatten these maps,

00:00:27.945 --> 00:00:31.019
creating a feature vector that we can then pass to a series of

00:00:31.019 --> 00:00:36.185
fully-connected linear layers to produce a probability distribution of class course.

00:00:36.185 --> 00:00:40.329
From this, we can extract the predicted class for the input image.

00:00:40.329 --> 00:00:44.795
In short, an image comes in and a predicted class label comes out.

00:00:44.795 --> 00:00:47.270
You've learned the foundational concepts behind

00:00:47.270 --> 00:00:49.910
CNN's and in later lessons you'll learn about

00:00:49.909 --> 00:00:52.534
techniques that leverage existing architectures

00:00:52.534 --> 00:00:55.634
and even more techniques for improving the performance of a model.

00:00:55.634 --> 00:01:00.644
You should also know that CNN's are not restricted to the task of image classification.

00:01:00.645 --> 00:01:04.760
They can be applied to any task with a fixed number of outputs such

00:01:04.760 --> 00:01:09.535
as regression tasks that look at points on a face or detect human poses.

00:01:09.534 --> 00:01:14.659
The applications of CNN's are very far-reaching and after seeing just a few,

00:01:14.659 --> 00:01:17.079
I hope you're excited to learn even more.

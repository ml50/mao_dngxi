00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.359
When we talk about spatial patterns in an image,

00:00:03.359 --> 00:00:05.544
we're often talking about one of two things,

00:00:05.544 --> 00:00:08.945
color or shape, and I want to focus on shape for a moment.

00:00:08.945 --> 00:00:12.945
Shape can also be thought of as patterns of intensity in an image.

00:00:12.945 --> 00:00:16.635
Intensity is a measure of light and dark, similar to brightness,

00:00:16.635 --> 00:00:20.804
and we can often use this knowledge to detect the shape of objects in an image.

00:00:20.804 --> 00:00:25.219
For example, say, you're trying to distinguish a person from a background in an image.

00:00:25.219 --> 00:00:28.969
You can look at the contrast that occurs where the person ends and the background

00:00:28.969 --> 00:00:32.820
begins to define a shape boundary that separates the two.

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:38.060
You can often identify the edges of an object by looking at abrupt changes in intensity,

00:00:38.060 --> 00:00:41.590
which happen when an image changes from a very dark to light area.

00:00:41.590 --> 00:00:43.130
In the next few videos,

00:00:43.130 --> 00:00:46.400
you'll be using and creating specific image filters that look at

00:00:46.399 --> 00:00:50.140
groups of pixels and detect big changes in intensity in an image.

00:00:50.140 --> 00:00:54.070
These filters produce an output that shows various edges and shapes.

00:00:54.070 --> 00:00:56.539
So, let's take a closer look at these filters and

00:00:56.539 --> 00:00:59.310
see what role they play in a convolutional neural network.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
A convolutional neural network is a special kind of

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:06.209
neural network in that it can remember spatial information.

00:00:06.209 --> 00:00:10.120
The neural networks that you've seen so far only look at individual inputs.

00:00:10.119 --> 00:00:11.750
But convolutional neural networks,

00:00:11.750 --> 00:00:13.560
can look at an image as a whole,

00:00:13.560 --> 00:00:16.820
or in patches and analyze groups of pixels at a time.

00:00:16.820 --> 00:00:19.199
The key to preserving the spatial information

00:00:19.199 --> 00:00:21.375
is something called the convolutional layer.

00:00:21.375 --> 00:00:23.759
A convolutional layer applies a series of

00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:28.155
different image filters also known as convolutional kernels to an input image.

00:00:28.155 --> 00:00:30.975
The resulting filtered images have different appearances.

00:00:30.975 --> 00:00:34.890
The filters may have extracted features like the edges of objects in that image,

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:37.920
or the colors that distinguish the different classes of images.

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:40.695
In the case of classifying digits for example,

00:00:40.695 --> 00:00:43.820
CNN should learn to identify spatial patterns like

00:00:43.820 --> 00:00:48.094
the curves and lines that make up the number six as distinct from another digit.

00:00:48.094 --> 00:00:51.439
Later layers in a model will learn how to combine different color

00:00:51.439 --> 00:00:54.844
and spatial features to produce an output like a class label.

00:00:54.844 --> 00:00:59.629
Before we get into defining and training a complete CNN in the next couple videos,

00:00:59.630 --> 00:01:03.065
you'll learn a bit more about the filters that define a convolutional layer.

00:01:03.064 --> 00:01:06.189
How they're defined, and how they can transform an input image?

00:01:06.189 --> 00:01:09.859
This will be important foundational knowledge that will come up again as you get to

00:01:09.859 --> 00:01:14.239
training as CNN and even visualizing the inner workings of a trained CNN.

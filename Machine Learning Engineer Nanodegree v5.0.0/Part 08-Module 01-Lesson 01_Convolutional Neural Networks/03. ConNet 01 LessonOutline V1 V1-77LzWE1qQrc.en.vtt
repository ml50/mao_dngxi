00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.459
I'll be teaching this lesson in tandem with Alexis.

00:00:03.459 --> 00:00:06.120
And as she already mentioned this lesson is all about

00:00:06.120 --> 00:00:10.699
convolutional neural networks and how they improve our ability to classify images.

00:00:10.699 --> 00:00:14.399
In general, CNNs can look at images as a whole and learn to

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:18.060
identify spatial patterns such as prominent colors and shapes,

00:00:18.059 --> 00:00:21.404
or whether a texture is fuzzy or smooth and so on.

00:00:21.405 --> 00:00:24.240
The shapes and colors that define any image and

00:00:24.239 --> 00:00:27.674
any object in an image are often called features.

00:00:27.675 --> 00:00:30.390
I'll cover how a CNN can learn to identify

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:34.380
these features and how a CNN can be used for image classification.

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:36.590
And Alexis will talk about the various layers that

00:00:36.590 --> 00:00:39.345
make up a complete convolutional neural network.

00:00:39.344 --> 00:00:40.744
By the end of this lesson,

00:00:40.744 --> 00:00:42.799
you should have all the skills you need to

00:00:42.799 --> 00:00:45.820
define and train an image classifier of your own.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.460
The capstone project represents

00:00:08.460 --> 00:00:12.540
an experiment and the project itself is really to decide what next.

00:00:12.539 --> 00:00:14.910
How do we take this experimental data that's been

00:00:14.910 --> 00:00:18.410
rolling for about a month and turn that into,

00:00:18.410 --> 00:00:23.734
discover which are the groups in there and what are the offers that really excite people?

00:00:23.734 --> 00:00:28.730
So, the Capstone Project is about discovering what is the best offer in there,

00:00:28.730 --> 00:00:33.975
not just for the population as a whole but at an individual personalized level.

00:00:33.975 --> 00:00:37.880
This is a simulated data for the sake of testing the algorithms,

00:00:37.880 --> 00:00:40.705
not simulated data for the sake of mimicking real people.

00:00:40.704 --> 00:00:44.619
Certain kinds of people will respond to certain offers in different ways.

00:00:44.619 --> 00:00:46.544
Some people may respond negatively.

00:00:46.545 --> 00:00:52.115
That's another thing to watch out for in some of these experiments is that,

00:00:52.115 --> 00:00:55.100
sometimes people really don't want to see what you have to

00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:58.340
send them and the best thing to do is to not send something.

00:00:58.340 --> 00:01:02.795
What you'll want to know is that you understand the cause and effect and that largely

00:01:02.795 --> 00:01:05.150
the way you're framing and thinking about

00:01:05.150 --> 00:01:08.600
the problem is consistent with what the data's telling you.

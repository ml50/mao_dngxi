00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.745
I'm here with Timo from Arvato.

00:00:02.745 --> 00:00:05.810
You saw him in the first term of this program.

00:00:05.809 --> 00:00:10.934
But you're back again for another project where we're working with the same data,

00:00:10.935 --> 00:00:15.109
but we left a lot of the complexity this time,

00:00:15.109 --> 00:00:16.554
that we removed the first time.

00:00:16.554 --> 00:00:19.519
Can you talk about the third data set that's introduced as well

00:00:19.519 --> 00:00:22.504
as what's the ending goal that Arvato uses this data for?

00:00:22.504 --> 00:00:29.210
Sure. Firstly, welcome back and thank you for working on another project with our data.

00:00:29.210 --> 00:00:31.789
I hope you liked the initial one.

00:00:31.789 --> 00:00:38.579
Now, we're introducing a third data set that you can use to actually evaluate your model,

00:00:38.579 --> 00:00:45.129
and test your recommendations you would be giving to our client with that model.

00:00:45.130 --> 00:00:48.109
The project you have been working on is a real-life project.

00:00:48.109 --> 00:00:53.274
It's a project you would be working on as a data scientist at Bertelsmann Arvato.

00:00:53.274 --> 00:00:55.479
We have similar projects like this,

00:00:55.479 --> 00:00:58.669
where you would be analyzing attributes,

00:00:58.670 --> 00:01:02.195
customers, for example, to recommend credit scores.

00:01:02.195 --> 00:01:05.530
We're looking at several of these attributes you have been working

00:01:05.530 --> 00:01:10.439
on to identify payment behavior,

00:01:10.439 --> 00:01:17.564
predict payment behavior, recommend credit scores, calculate credit scores.

00:01:17.564 --> 00:01:20.810
Can you talk a little bit about what you

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:24.579
want as an ending goal from a business perspective?

00:01:24.579 --> 00:01:29.689
So, this whole new third data set that's come into play,

00:01:29.689 --> 00:01:34.799
now opens up a world of different questions and how we might be able to answer them.

00:01:34.799 --> 00:01:41.614
Absolutely. The underlying business question or the kind of problem statement is,

00:01:41.614 --> 00:01:44.699
"How can our client,

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:49.840
the mail-order company acquire new clients more efficiently?"

00:01:49.840 --> 00:01:52.814
What we're asking you to do is essentially,

00:01:52.814 --> 00:01:59.280
you have the attributes and the demographic information of the existing clients,

00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:05.245
we would like you to analyze the attributes of these existing clients,

00:02:05.245 --> 00:02:06.829
match them against a second,

00:02:06.829 --> 00:02:12.560
the bigger data set that includes attributes for people in Germany,

00:02:12.560 --> 00:02:16.990
and essentially figure out which people in Germany are

00:02:16.990 --> 00:02:21.485
most likely new customers for our client,

00:02:21.485 --> 00:02:25.695
the mail-order company selling organic products.

00:02:25.694 --> 00:02:28.109
From our kind of view,

00:02:28.110 --> 00:02:29.955
it's a real-life project.

00:02:29.955 --> 00:02:32.500
So essntially, what it has to do is increase

00:02:32.500 --> 00:02:36.254
efficiency in the customer acquisition process.

00:02:36.254 --> 00:02:40.329
So, instead of the mail order company reaching out to all people

00:02:40.330 --> 00:02:44.735
in Germany and targeting them with a marketing campaign,

00:02:44.735 --> 00:02:48.240
we would just then be reaching out to

00:02:48.240 --> 00:02:55.830
the people we identified as becoming most likely new customers,

00:02:55.830 --> 00:03:00.680
and then do targeted advertising. That what it is.

00:03:00.680 --> 00:03:03.580
Great. Right now, they have a culture where they make

00:03:03.580 --> 00:03:07.825
decisions based on past experiences,

00:03:07.824 --> 00:03:12.244
intuition, and a lot of that is okay.

00:03:12.245 --> 00:03:16.935
But if they can infuse those decisions by also backing them up with data,

00:03:16.935 --> 00:03:18.449
or even showing like,

00:03:18.449 --> 00:03:23.439
we can go even further with this decision in x direction or y direction,

00:03:23.439 --> 00:03:25.419
that's where you guys come in. Is that true?

00:03:25.419 --> 00:03:27.939
Absolutely. That's what we're doing.

00:03:27.939 --> 00:03:32.340
The mission of our engagement is make decisions based on data instead of gut feel.

00:03:32.340 --> 00:03:35.180
Of course, we are dealing with senior finance managers,

00:03:35.180 --> 00:03:37.319
and they do have a lot of experience,

00:03:37.319 --> 00:03:42.669
but our client is really conscious that they are using data points,

00:03:42.669 --> 00:03:49.979
through to proofs, and show the rationale behind their decisions.

00:03:49.979 --> 00:03:54.500
So, we would like to have them use more reports,

00:03:54.500 --> 00:03:56.685
use reports more often,

00:03:56.685 --> 00:04:01.620
request more reports, and actually use the data we are providing.

00:04:01.620 --> 00:04:04.545
Timo, thanks so much for some insights into the data set.

00:04:04.544 --> 00:04:09.369
Sure. Thank you very much for participating in this project.

00:04:09.370 --> 00:04:11.545
I hope you find it insightful.

00:04:11.544 --> 00:04:14.949
As I mentioned, it's data we're using.

00:04:14.949 --> 00:04:18.009
It's a real data science project.

00:04:18.009 --> 00:04:20.039
So, thank you very much for that.

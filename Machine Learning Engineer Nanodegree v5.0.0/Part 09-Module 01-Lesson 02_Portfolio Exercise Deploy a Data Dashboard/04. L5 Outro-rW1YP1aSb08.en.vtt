00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.725
It's time to celebrate.

00:00:02.725 --> 00:00:05.865
You've achieved so much in this course.

00:00:05.865 --> 00:00:09.440
You've gained experience with software engineering practices,

00:00:09.439 --> 00:00:11.359
that help you produce efficient,

00:00:11.359 --> 00:00:13.719
robust and maintainable code.

00:00:13.720 --> 00:00:15.585
I can't emphasize enough,

00:00:15.585 --> 00:00:19.380
how much these skills will make you stronger as a data scientist.

00:00:19.379 --> 00:00:25.134
So, be sure to apply them in your daily work and your professional portfolio.

00:00:25.135 --> 00:00:27.179
You've also gained experience with

00:00:27.179 --> 00:00:30.780
object-oriented programming and writing a Python package.

00:00:30.780 --> 00:00:36.090
You now have a sense for how packages like scikit-learn and pandas work under the hood.

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:41.385
Use these skills to write your own packages and share your code with the world.

00:00:41.384 --> 00:00:47.254
Finally, you've built a web application that loads a data dashboard.

00:00:47.255 --> 00:00:50.510
We encourage you to take the template code from

00:00:50.509 --> 00:00:54.589
the web development lesson and reuse it for your own purposes.

00:00:54.590 --> 00:00:59.975
It's a great way to show off your data analysis and data storytelling skills.

00:00:59.975 --> 00:01:02.719
This course was designed to get you comfortable with

00:01:02.719 --> 00:01:05.625
writing code for real world applications.

00:01:05.625 --> 00:01:07.459
The stronger you are at coding,

00:01:07.459 --> 00:01:10.629
the more success you'll have as a data scientist.

00:01:10.629 --> 00:01:14.030
Definitely. Data science is powerful.

00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:16.829
But to bring its contributions to production,

00:01:16.829 --> 00:01:19.504
you often need software engineering.

00:01:19.504 --> 00:01:23.179
Although the amount of software engineering you need to know,

00:01:23.180 --> 00:01:26.010
will vary across teams and companies,

00:01:26.010 --> 00:01:32.120
developing these skills will really help you with implementing your data science ideas.

00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:35.570
Be sure to share what you've built on the Slack channel,

00:01:35.569 --> 00:01:38.809
on a personal blog and in a GitHub repository.

00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:42.200
We're really excited to see what you build.

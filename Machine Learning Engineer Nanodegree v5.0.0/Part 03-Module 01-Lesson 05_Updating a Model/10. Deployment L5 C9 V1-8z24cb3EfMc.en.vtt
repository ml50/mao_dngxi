00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.310
Before we leave off, let's quickly go over

00:00:02.310 --> 00:00:05.189
the different Amazon web services resources that we've

00:00:05.190 --> 00:00:08.240
used and make sure that everything has been shut down and cleaned out.

00:00:08.240 --> 00:00:13.080
To begin with, you should make sure that any notebook that you have is stopped,

00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:16.140
that is not in service remember that you

00:00:16.140 --> 00:00:19.560
are charged for the length of time that your notebook instance is running.

00:00:19.559 --> 00:00:22.574
So, if you have any running you should make sure to stop them.

00:00:22.574 --> 00:00:26.024
Also, you should double-check that you don't have any endpoints running.

00:00:26.024 --> 00:00:28.529
Remember just like notebook instances,

00:00:28.530 --> 00:00:31.109
you are charged for the length of time that an endpoint is running for.

00:00:31.109 --> 00:00:33.659
So if you have any running you should make sure to shut them down too.

00:00:33.659 --> 00:00:37.684
Those are the sage maker specific resources that we've used throughout.

00:00:37.685 --> 00:00:41.200
But let's take a look at some of the other Amazon services that we've used.

00:00:41.200 --> 00:00:42.460
Clicking on the top left corner,

00:00:42.460 --> 00:00:44.719
we can go back to the main Amazon console.

00:00:44.719 --> 00:00:46.070
Aside from Sage Maker,

00:00:46.070 --> 00:00:48.905
we've used three other Amazon Web Services.

00:00:48.905 --> 00:00:52.929
The first is S3 which is listed here under storage.

00:00:52.929 --> 00:00:57.170
In the free tier, you're given a certain amount of storage and S3 that you

00:00:57.170 --> 00:01:01.325
aren't charged for but beyond that or if you are no longer in free tier,

00:01:01.325 --> 00:01:06.695
it costs you some small amount of money for the space that you occupy on S3.

00:01:06.694 --> 00:01:09.424
So if you're done with all of the data you should make sure to delete it.

00:01:09.424 --> 00:01:11.974
In my case, I would just delete the entire bucket.

00:01:11.974 --> 00:01:13.834
Heading back to the main console,

00:01:13.834 --> 00:01:18.064
one of the other services that we used was Amazon Lambda,

00:01:18.064 --> 00:01:20.844
which is listed under the compute heading.

00:01:20.844 --> 00:01:25.250
With Lambda, you're only charged whenever your Lambda function is executed,

00:01:25.250 --> 00:01:26.810
and in the free tier you're allowed to have

00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:29.135
some number of executions before you're charged.

00:01:29.135 --> 00:01:32.135
If you don't want to have a Lambda function hanging around in your account,

00:01:32.135 --> 00:01:33.440
you can just make sure delete it.

00:01:33.439 --> 00:01:34.674
I've already deleted mine.

00:01:34.674 --> 00:01:37.484
Lastly, heading back to the main console,

00:01:37.484 --> 00:01:41.239
the third Amazon service that we used was API gateway.

00:01:41.239 --> 00:01:47.149
You can get to API Gateway by scrolling down to networking and content delivery.

00:01:47.150 --> 00:01:50.030
Remember that API Gateway allowed us to create

00:01:50.030 --> 00:01:53.435
an endpoint that sent data to the Lambda function.

00:01:53.435 --> 00:01:58.409
If you don't want any endpoint configurations hanging around on your account,

00:01:58.409 --> 00:01:59.689
you can also delete that here.

00:01:59.689 --> 00:02:00.810
I've already done that.

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:04.534
That's it for the Amazon services that we used in this module.

00:02:04.534 --> 00:02:08.599
It's a good idea to make a habit of going through and checking each of the resources

00:02:08.599 --> 00:02:10.639
that you've used to make sure you don't have anything

00:02:10.639 --> 00:02:13.129
hanging around that may incur a cost.

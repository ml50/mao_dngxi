00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.540
In this lesson,we're going to look at how you can change

00:00:03.540 --> 00:00:06.915
a deployed model without needing to first shut it down.

00:00:06.915 --> 00:00:10.080
There are many situations that might arise during the life of

00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:13.919
a deployed model that would cause it to no longer function as well.

00:00:13.919 --> 00:00:18.649
For example, maybe you're creating a recommendation engine and

00:00:18.649 --> 00:00:23.734
its job is to recommend to a user different articles they might find interesting.

00:00:23.734 --> 00:00:27.574
Over time, your user could develop new interests,

00:00:27.574 --> 00:00:30.704
or maybe old interests no longer apply.

00:00:30.704 --> 00:00:35.104
In that case, retraining your model might be a good idea.

00:00:35.104 --> 00:00:40.359
Once you do, you will need to deploy that new model and replace the old one.

00:00:40.359 --> 00:00:43.369
SageMaker provides functionality to let you do

00:00:43.369 --> 00:00:46.280
this without interrupting service to the end-user.

00:00:46.280 --> 00:00:50.760
Next, you're going to learn how to use this functionality yourself.

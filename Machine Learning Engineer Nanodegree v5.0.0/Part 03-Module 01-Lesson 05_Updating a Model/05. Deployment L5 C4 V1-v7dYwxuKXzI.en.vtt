00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.815
In this mini-project, we're going to take a look at a fun problem that

00:00:04.815 --> 00:00:09.690
tries to mimic in some ways the sort of issue you may encounter in a real life scenario.

00:00:09.689 --> 00:00:15.329
In particular, once you've created a model and it's deployed and being used,

00:00:15.330 --> 00:00:19.440
what happens if the underlying data distribution changes,

00:00:19.440 --> 00:00:21.870
so that your model no longer performs,

00:00:21.870 --> 00:00:23.355
as well as it once did?

00:00:23.355 --> 00:00:28.920
In this notebook, you'll go through the process of examining some new data,

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:32.550
trying to figure out why your model no longer behaves,

00:00:32.549 --> 00:00:38.265
as well as it once did and then updating that model to take into account the new data.

00:00:38.265 --> 00:00:40.274
If you get stuck, don't worry,

00:00:40.274 --> 00:00:43.890
solutions are provided and in the next few videos,

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:45.799
we'll go over my solutions.

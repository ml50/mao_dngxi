00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.805
In this video, I wanted to give you a few tips and tricks

00:00:02.805 --> 00:00:05.384
that I've used while developing some of this material.

00:00:05.384 --> 00:00:08.460
SageMaker is a wonderful tool that can really help

00:00:08.460 --> 00:00:11.880
reduce the development time of a lot of machine learning projects.

00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:15.795
However, problems can be sometimes difficult to diagnose.

00:00:15.794 --> 00:00:19.589
We spoke in a previous video about using the CloudWatch Logs,

00:00:19.589 --> 00:00:22.125
and it's something that I have found very helpful.

00:00:22.125 --> 00:00:24.269
In particular, say I'm training something,

00:00:24.269 --> 00:00:25.725
I can look at the training job,

00:00:25.725 --> 00:00:27.445
and see if it has failed.

00:00:27.445 --> 00:00:30.350
The most recent training jobs here have no failures,

00:00:30.350 --> 00:00:32.179
but I can take a look at one of them,

00:00:32.179 --> 00:00:33.770
and if I scroll down,

00:00:33.770 --> 00:00:38.990
there is a link to the CloudWatch logs, which I can open up.

00:00:38.990 --> 00:00:42.469
To take a look at the output that was generated by that training job,

00:00:42.469 --> 00:00:44.554
I found this to be very, very helpful.

00:00:44.554 --> 00:00:46.670
This is especially true when you

00:00:46.670 --> 00:00:50.975
are training a model that allows you to incorporate your own code.

00:00:50.975 --> 00:00:52.969
For example, any PyTorch model,

00:00:52.969 --> 00:00:56.045
where you get to include your own training method.

00:00:56.045 --> 00:00:59.149
Sometimes errors can occur that are very difficult to diagnose.

00:00:59.149 --> 00:01:02.060
But, taking a look at the output here can be very helpful,

00:01:02.060 --> 00:01:06.394
especially if you include some additional output in your provided code.

00:01:06.394 --> 00:01:09.229
Another general trick that I should mention is

00:01:09.230 --> 00:01:12.745
that you should not be afraid of copying and pasting.

00:01:12.745 --> 00:01:16.290
It is certainly the case that many of the things you need to do inside of

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:20.740
SageMaker are very similar to other things that you've done outside of SageMaker.

00:01:20.739 --> 00:01:22.229
Training a model, for example,

00:01:22.230 --> 00:01:24.259
sometimes requires a few lines of code,

00:01:24.259 --> 00:01:28.310
but the changes between two different models being trained is typically very small.

00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:30.019
So, copy and paste is your friend.

00:01:30.019 --> 00:01:32.810
Another thing I'd like to mention is the documentation.

00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:37.025
The main documentation is this document here,

00:01:37.025 --> 00:01:42.415
however, SageMaker, the platform itself, moves very quickly.

00:01:42.415 --> 00:01:45.080
Sometimes more quickly than the documentation.

00:01:45.079 --> 00:01:48.230
So, you're not always able to find all of

00:01:48.230 --> 00:01:52.160
the features that are available in the documentation.

00:01:52.159 --> 00:01:54.424
It's a fantastic place to look to start,

00:01:54.424 --> 00:01:56.719
but sometimes you have to look a little deeper.

00:01:56.719 --> 00:02:01.489
Another useful piece of documentation is the Python SDK.

00:02:01.489 --> 00:02:04.039
We've been calling this the high-level approach.

00:02:04.040 --> 00:02:08.254
In this document sort of a different approach to using SageMaker,

00:02:08.254 --> 00:02:09.775
which can be helpful as well,

00:02:09.775 --> 00:02:12.674
and this document is also fantastic,

00:02:12.674 --> 00:02:17.060
but at times suffers from the same problem as the previous document in that,

00:02:17.060 --> 00:02:19.640
the code-based moves faster than the documentation.

00:02:19.639 --> 00:02:21.469
When in doubt, I would say,

00:02:21.469 --> 00:02:24.919
don't be afraid to look at the actual codebase itself.

00:02:24.919 --> 00:02:28.250
Fortunately it's provided here on GitHub.

00:02:28.250 --> 00:02:31.099
One of the reasons this is really helpful is that

00:02:31.099 --> 00:02:35.954
the Python SDK or the high-level approach as I said in a previous video,

00:02:35.955 --> 00:02:37.770
make some choices on your behalf,

00:02:37.770 --> 00:02:41.630
which can be fantastic because it can reduce the development time,

00:02:41.629 --> 00:02:43.159
but it can also be a little difficult to

00:02:43.159 --> 00:02:45.250
diagnose because you're not always sure what's happening.

00:02:45.250 --> 00:02:47.620
If you want to know exactly what's happening,

00:02:47.620 --> 00:02:50.314
checking the actual code can be really helpful.

00:02:50.314 --> 00:02:54.020
For example, I can open up the estimator Python file,

00:02:54.020 --> 00:02:58.070
which will include the description of the estimator class.

00:02:58.069 --> 00:02:59.449
That way I can scroll down,

00:02:59.449 --> 00:03:01.000
and take a look at say,

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:04.520
what's happening when I try and set some hyper parameters,

00:03:04.520 --> 00:03:07.159
or train, or fit the model.

00:03:07.159 --> 00:03:09.919
I've actually found looking through the code to be really helpful.

00:03:09.919 --> 00:03:11.419
It's also very well documented.

00:03:11.419 --> 00:03:13.054
So, when I get stuck,

00:03:13.055 --> 00:03:15.034
that's usually where I turned.

00:03:15.034 --> 00:03:18.710
One last tip that I'll give you is that most

00:03:18.710 --> 00:03:21.890
of the problems that I encountered while developing this material,

00:03:21.889 --> 00:03:25.464
had to do with naming the various objects that were created.

00:03:25.465 --> 00:03:29.240
The fact that you need to have a unique name is a blessing and a curse.

00:03:29.240 --> 00:03:30.320
It is a blessing in that,

00:03:30.319 --> 00:03:34.969
you can reuse many of the objects that you've created at a later time,

00:03:34.969 --> 00:03:37.055
since each one has a unique name.

00:03:37.055 --> 00:03:39.990
It can be a curse when you don't

00:03:39.990 --> 00:03:43.250
quite pay attention to the naming convention that you've been using,

00:03:43.250 --> 00:03:46.895
or you're not careful about making sure your names are unique.

00:03:46.895 --> 00:03:51.200
Tips and tricks aside, I hope you enjoy playing with SageMaker. Good luck.

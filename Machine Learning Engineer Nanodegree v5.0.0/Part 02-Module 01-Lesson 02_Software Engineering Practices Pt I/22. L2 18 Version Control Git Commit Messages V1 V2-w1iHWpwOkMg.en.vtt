00:00:04.129 --> 00:00:08.419
After working on this recommendation feature for a while,

00:00:08.419 --> 00:00:12.745
you've created a model to produce recommendations based on friend groups.

00:00:12.744 --> 00:00:16.899
The model is scored pretty well on your validation set,

00:00:16.899 --> 00:00:20.744
but you remember it did even better just a few hours ago.

00:00:20.745 --> 00:00:23.970
You've been experimenting with tweaks to this model,

00:00:23.969 --> 00:00:26.759
and you're not sure what combination of parameters

00:00:26.759 --> 00:00:30.265
and tweaks were in place when your model scored the highest.

00:00:30.265 --> 00:00:35.460
Luckily, you've been including a message with each commit noting what

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:40.689
you did as well as the training and cross-validation scores for each commit.

00:00:40.689 --> 00:00:44.869
Instead of spending a bunch of time trying to retrace your steps from

00:00:44.869 --> 00:00:49.649
memory or testing a bunch of tweaks again to try and get the same score,

00:00:49.649 --> 00:00:52.804
you can check your commit history seeing messages

00:00:52.804 --> 00:00:56.799
of the changes you need and how well it performed.

00:00:56.799 --> 00:01:01.140
The model at this commit seem to be scoring the highest,

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:03.295
so you decide to take a look.

00:01:03.295 --> 00:01:05.260
After inspecting your code,

00:01:05.260 --> 00:01:11.460
you've realized what modifications made this perform well and use those for your model.

00:01:11.459 --> 00:01:15.574
Now, you're pretty confident merging this back

00:01:15.575 --> 00:01:19.280
to the develop branch and pushing the updated recommendation engine.

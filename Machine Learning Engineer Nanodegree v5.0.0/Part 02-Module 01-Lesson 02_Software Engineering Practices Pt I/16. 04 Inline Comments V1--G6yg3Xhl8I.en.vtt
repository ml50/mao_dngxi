00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.639
The first mode of documentation we'll talk about are in-line comments.

00:00:04.639 --> 00:00:07.750
By now, you've probably seen this many times,

00:00:07.750 --> 00:00:11.085
texts following a hash symbol throughout your code.

00:00:11.085 --> 00:00:14.010
They're used to explain parts of your code and

00:00:14.009 --> 00:00:16.579
really help future contributors understand your work.

00:00:16.579 --> 00:00:19.039
There are different ways comments are used

00:00:19.039 --> 00:00:22.184
and definitely differences among great comments,

00:00:22.184 --> 00:00:25.154
okay comments, and even users' comments.

00:00:25.155 --> 00:00:27.710
One way comments are used is to document

00:00:27.710 --> 00:00:31.455
the major steps of complex code to help readers follow.

00:00:31.454 --> 00:00:35.199
For example, with the guiding comments in this function,

00:00:35.200 --> 00:00:39.330
you don't really need to understand the code to follow what this function does.

00:00:39.329 --> 00:00:41.585
If I was seeing this for the first time

00:00:41.585 --> 00:00:44.605
and I had no idea what these functions or tools were,

00:00:44.604 --> 00:00:49.399
these comments really help me understand the purpose of each block of code,

00:00:49.399 --> 00:00:53.509
and even help me figure out individual lines of code or methods.

00:00:53.509 --> 00:00:58.809
However, others would argue that this is using comments to justify bad code,

00:00:58.810 --> 00:01:01.770
and that if code requires comments to follow,

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:04.130
it's a sign refactoring is needed.

00:01:04.129 --> 00:01:08.140
Comments are valuable for explaining where code cannot.

00:01:08.140 --> 00:01:13.974
For example, the history behind why a certain method was implemented in a specific way.

00:01:13.974 --> 00:01:18.034
Sometimes an unconventional or seemingly arbitrary approach

00:01:18.034 --> 00:01:22.604
may be used because of some obscure external variable causing side effects.

00:01:22.605 --> 00:01:25.340
These things are difficult to explain with code.

00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:30.139
These numbers for detecting edge levels in an image may seem arbitrary,

00:01:30.138 --> 00:01:33.560
but the programmer experimented with different numbers and

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:38.269
realized that this was the one that worked for this specific use case.

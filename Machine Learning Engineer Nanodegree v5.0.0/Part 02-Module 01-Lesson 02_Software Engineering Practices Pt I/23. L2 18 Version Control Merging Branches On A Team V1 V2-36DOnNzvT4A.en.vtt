00:00:04.309 --> 00:00:09.899
While you were working on these changes, your co-worker, Andrew,

00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:13.290
has been working on improvements to the documentation of

00:00:13.289 --> 00:00:18.570
the same recommendation engine on a different branch called Documentation.

00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:23.129
Andrew commits his changes to the documentation branch,

00:00:23.129 --> 00:00:26.579
switches to the development branch and pulls down

00:00:26.579 --> 00:00:30.479
the latest changes from the remote repository on this branch,

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:35.329
which includes the change I previously merged for the friend groups feature.

00:00:35.329 --> 00:00:38.864
Then, Andrew merges his documentation branch

00:00:38.865 --> 00:00:42.414
to the develop branch on his local repository,

00:00:42.414 --> 00:00:48.625
and then pushes his changes up to update the develop branch on the remote repository.

00:00:48.625 --> 00:00:51.909
After the team reviewed both of your work,

00:00:51.909 --> 00:00:56.979
they merged update from the develop branch to the master branch.

00:00:56.979 --> 00:01:02.354
Now, they pushed the changes to the master branch on the remote repository.

00:01:02.354 --> 00:01:05.594
These changes are now in production.

00:01:05.594 --> 00:01:08.334
Using branches, commit messages,

00:01:08.334 --> 00:01:12.259
and merging demonstrate just a few ways version control

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:14.895
can be used in data science on a team,

00:01:14.894 --> 00:01:18.170
but the process will vary based on your team

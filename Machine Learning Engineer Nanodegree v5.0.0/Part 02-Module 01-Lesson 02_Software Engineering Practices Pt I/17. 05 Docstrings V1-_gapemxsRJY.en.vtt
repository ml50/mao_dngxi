00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.620
Docstrings or documentation strings are valuable pieces of

00:00:04.620 --> 00:00:10.050
documentation that explain the functionality of any function or module in your code.

00:00:10.050 --> 00:00:13.975
Ideally, all of your functions should have docstrings.

00:00:13.974 --> 00:00:16.745
Here's a function for population density.

00:00:16.745 --> 00:00:20.519
A docstring is always surrounded by triple quotes.

00:00:20.519 --> 00:00:22.739
If you feel that this one line of

00:00:22.739 --> 00:00:26.779
documentation is sufficient for you to end the docstring at this point,

00:00:26.780 --> 00:00:29.845
single line docstrings are perfectly acceptable.

00:00:29.844 --> 00:00:32.490
If however, you think that the function is

00:00:32.490 --> 00:00:35.460
complicated enough to warrant a longer description,

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:39.829
you can add a more thorough paragraph after the one line summary.

00:00:39.829 --> 00:00:45.239
The next element of a docstring is an explanation of the function's arguments.

00:00:45.240 --> 00:00:47.685
Here, you list the arguments,

00:00:47.685 --> 00:00:52.480
state their purpose, and state what types the arguments should be.

00:00:52.479 --> 00:00:57.344
Finally, it's common to provide some description of the output of the function.

00:00:57.344 --> 00:01:00.100
Every piece of the docstring is optional.

00:01:00.100 --> 00:01:03.664
However, docstrings are part of good coding practice.

00:01:03.664 --> 00:01:09.094
They assist you and future users of your code in understanding the code you produce.

00:01:09.094 --> 00:01:14.530
You can read a more thorough explanation of docstring conventions in the link below.

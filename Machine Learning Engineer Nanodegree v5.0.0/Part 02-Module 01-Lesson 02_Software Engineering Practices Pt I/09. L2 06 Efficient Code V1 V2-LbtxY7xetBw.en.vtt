00:00:04.429 --> 00:00:09.059
When you refactor, it's important to improve the efficiency

00:00:09.060 --> 00:00:13.170
of your code in addition to making it clean and modular.

00:00:13.169 --> 00:00:19.490
There are two parts to making code efficient: reducing the time it takes to run,

00:00:19.489 --> 00:00:23.640
and reducing the amount of space it takes up and memory.

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:28.559
Both can have a significant impact on a company or products performance.

00:00:28.559 --> 00:00:30.975
So, it's important to practice this.

00:00:30.975 --> 00:00:36.100
It's especially important if you will be working in a production environment.

00:00:36.100 --> 00:00:40.189
However, it should be noted that how important

00:00:40.189 --> 00:00:44.344
it is to improve efficiency is context dependent.

00:00:44.344 --> 00:00:50.054
Slow code, might be possible in one case and not another.

00:00:50.054 --> 00:00:54.269
For example, some batch data preparation processes,

00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:57.680
might not need to be optimized right away if

00:00:57.679 --> 00:01:01.369
it runs once every three days, for a few minutes.

00:01:01.369 --> 00:01:03.125
On the other hand,

00:01:03.125 --> 00:01:09.829
code used to generate posts to show on a social media feed needs to be relatively fast,

00:01:09.829 --> 00:01:13.054
since updates happen instantaneously.

00:01:13.055 --> 00:01:17.000
Again, you may spend a lot of time refactoring to

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:21.519
clean or optimize your code after you already have something working.

00:01:21.519 --> 00:01:24.409
It's important to understand how valuable this

00:01:24.409 --> 00:01:28.390
is for your work and yourself as a developer.

00:01:28.390 --> 00:01:30.950
Each time you optimize your code,

00:01:30.950 --> 00:01:33.560
you'll pick up new knowledge and skills which will

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:36.885
make you a more efficient programmer over time.

00:01:36.885 --> 00:01:40.370
Let's see a few examples of inefficient code,

00:01:40.370 --> 00:01:44.680
and practice refactoring to optimize their performance.

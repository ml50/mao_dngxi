00:00:04.009 --> 00:00:10.750
Documentation is additional text or illustrated information that comes with,

00:00:10.750 --> 00:00:12.134
or is embedded in,

00:00:12.134 --> 00:00:14.050
the code of software.

00:00:14.050 --> 00:00:19.375
Documentation is helpful for clarifying complex parts of your program,

00:00:19.375 --> 00:00:24.240
making your code easy for yourself and others to navigate and

00:00:24.239 --> 00:00:29.614
quickly conveying how and why different components of your program are used.

00:00:29.614 --> 00:00:36.054
There are several types of documentation you can add at different levels of your program.

00:00:36.054 --> 00:00:39.179
First, you can add documentation at

00:00:39.179 --> 00:00:43.929
the line level using in-line comments to clarify your code.

00:00:43.929 --> 00:00:48.409
Second, you can add documentation at the function or

00:00:48.409 --> 00:00:53.929
module level using docstrings to describe its purpose and details.

00:00:53.929 --> 00:01:00.229
Finally, you can add documentation at the project level using various tools such as

00:01:00.229 --> 00:01:03.484
a readme file to document details about the project

00:01:03.484 --> 00:01:07.385
as a whole and how all the files work together.

00:01:07.385 --> 00:01:09.395
In the next few sections,

00:01:09.394 --> 00:01:13.969
we will practice using these different modes of documentation and learn

00:01:13.969 --> 00:01:19.959
best practices to make sure our documentation is effective and useful.

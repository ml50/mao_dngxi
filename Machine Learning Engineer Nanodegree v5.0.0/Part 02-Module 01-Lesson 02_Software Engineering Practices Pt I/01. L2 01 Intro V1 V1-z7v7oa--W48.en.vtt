00:00:04.280 --> 00:00:09.190
Welcome to part one of Software Engineering Practices.

00:00:09.189 --> 00:00:13.709
Here, we will go over a few techniques that we can adopt as

00:00:13.710 --> 00:00:19.214
data scientists to be better developers and prepare for production level code.

00:00:19.214 --> 00:00:23.714
You will learn how to write clean and modular code,

00:00:23.714 --> 00:00:26.539
improve your code's efficiency,

00:00:26.539 --> 00:00:31.554
document effectively, and use version control.

00:00:31.554 --> 00:00:34.909
These are all essential skills to develop as

00:00:34.909 --> 00:00:40.199
a programmer and will really help you when implementing production solutions.

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:46.330
In addition, data scientists often work side-by-side with software engineers,

00:00:46.329 --> 00:00:48.824
and it's important you work well together.

00:00:48.825 --> 00:00:52.670
This means being familiar with standard practices

00:00:52.670 --> 00:00:57.594
and being able to collaborate effectively with others on code.

00:00:57.594 --> 00:01:00.710
Let's walk through each of these practices and

00:01:00.710 --> 00:01:04.560
learn how they're applied as a data scientist.

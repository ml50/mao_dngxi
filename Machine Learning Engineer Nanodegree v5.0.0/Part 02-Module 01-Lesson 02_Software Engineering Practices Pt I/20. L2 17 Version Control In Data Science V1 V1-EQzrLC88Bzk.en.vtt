00:00:04.400 --> 00:00:07.860
As a prerequisite to this course,

00:00:07.860 --> 00:00:12.199
you should have already learned how to use Git for version control.

00:00:12.199 --> 00:00:14.964
If, however, you need a refresher,

00:00:14.964 --> 00:00:18.285
check out the course linked in the extracurriculars.

00:00:18.285 --> 00:00:22.789
To familiarize yourself with how you may use version control at work,

00:00:22.789 --> 00:00:24.750
we'll first take a look at

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:29.940
an example scenario where you are data scientists using Git at work.

00:00:29.940 --> 00:00:33.925
We'll practice the commands to use in these type of scenarios,

00:00:33.924 --> 00:00:36.269
and then we'll go over some of

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:40.800
the unique challenges and techniques for versioning data science work.

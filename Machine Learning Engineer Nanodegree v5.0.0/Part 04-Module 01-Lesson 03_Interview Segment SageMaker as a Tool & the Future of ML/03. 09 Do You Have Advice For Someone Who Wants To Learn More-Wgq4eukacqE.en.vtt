00:00:01.330 --> 00:00:05.639
You know there are all these resources out there if you do want to learn something

00:00:05.639 --> 00:00:10.589
from a like language in the world to a programming language.

00:00:10.589 --> 00:00:13.275
I wonder if you have any advice for someone who

00:00:13.275 --> 00:00:16.425
really wants to learn more about say like deployment,

00:00:16.425 --> 00:00:20.625
or SageMaker, or really building Machine Learning product end to end.

00:00:20.625 --> 00:00:27.480
Right. I guess the key advice that I have is stay curious, stay hungry.

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:34.634
Watch the market and the cool thing nowadays is that there's a lot of things online.

00:00:34.634 --> 00:00:40.439
So follow the key players especially folks that are investing in education, like Udacity,

00:00:40.439 --> 00:00:46.093
because besides getting information about a product,

00:00:46.094 --> 00:00:48.700
or a service, or technology,

00:00:48.700 --> 00:00:52.190
you also get information about market dynamics,

00:00:52.189 --> 00:00:54.859
about what are the technologies that are cool,

00:00:54.859 --> 00:01:00.500
what are the people that are at the forefront of these technologies interested in.

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:06.409
So then you can plan your trajectory of learning and then draw

00:01:06.409 --> 00:01:09.295
your interests in a different types of products and

00:01:09.295 --> 00:01:12.915
Machine Learning techniques that you want to learn.

00:01:12.915 --> 00:01:16.835
Stay curious and also just hop on the bandwagon of

00:01:16.834 --> 00:01:22.204
online education because there's a firehose out there of information.

00:01:22.204 --> 00:01:25.349
There's a lot of Machine Learning Algorithms,

00:01:25.349 --> 00:01:26.729
there's a lot of tools,

00:01:26.730 --> 00:01:30.590
there's a lot of frameworks and it gets really

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:35.615
confusing when you want to navigate bad ecosystem yourself.

00:01:35.614 --> 00:01:42.319
So it's very useful to work with an online learning tool that

00:01:42.319 --> 00:01:45.649
can guide you through the learning process and point you towards

00:01:45.650 --> 00:01:49.425
some beacons that can really help you learn faster,

00:01:49.424 --> 00:01:51.584
and ignore the noise out there.

00:01:51.584 --> 00:01:57.349
That's kind of part of the goal again that we have at SageMaker which is to bring

00:01:57.349 --> 00:01:59.899
Machine Learning in front of the people that

00:01:59.900 --> 00:02:03.230
particularly wouldn't have a science or engineering background,

00:02:03.230 --> 00:02:05.165
but could use Machine Learning.

00:02:05.165 --> 00:02:09.080
So the platform includes examples like we just

00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:13.955
discussed that can guide people through really making Machine Learning useful.

00:02:13.955 --> 00:02:15.635
So ignore the noise for a minute,

00:02:15.634 --> 00:02:17.899
go through this specific example,

00:02:17.900 --> 00:02:19.849
and then at the end of going through the example,

00:02:19.849 --> 00:02:22.944
you would have learned something useful, something practical,

00:02:22.944 --> 00:02:27.009
and you would have also learned a lot about Machine Learning theoretically.

00:02:27.009 --> 00:02:30.164
So guided learning, staying curious,

00:02:30.164 --> 00:02:32.104
watching the market and industry,

00:02:32.104 --> 00:02:36.759
finding the key players in education and product development and product building,

00:02:36.759 --> 00:02:38.669
getting to know their interests,

00:02:38.669 --> 00:02:41.759
and then following that interest and trying to draw

00:02:41.759 --> 00:02:47.579
a roadmap for yourself that you can use for your next learning activities.

00:02:47.580 --> 00:02:52.085
I agree. It's something where this field is changing so are the tools.

00:02:52.085 --> 00:02:56.545
So as long as you keep on learning driven by your own interests and curiosity,

00:02:56.544 --> 00:02:58.519
I think that's really the route to go.

00:02:58.520 --> 00:03:00.665
I feel very lucky to work somewhere where I can partner

00:03:00.664 --> 00:03:03.139
with someone in industry because I really get to learn a lot.

00:03:03.139 --> 00:03:04.879
So I want to thank you for joining us,

00:03:04.879 --> 00:03:07.954
and just say hello to our students out there.

00:03:07.955 --> 00:03:09.335
Thank you for having me,

00:03:09.335 --> 00:03:12.735
and Machine Learning for the win.

00:03:12.735 --> 00:03:14.380
For the win.

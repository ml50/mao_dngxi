00:00:05.509 --> 00:00:11.500
So we've been talking a lot about specific products or people that are using SageMaker.

00:00:11.500 --> 00:00:15.189
I was wondering that if you see some group of

00:00:15.189 --> 00:00:18.879
people that maybe has some hesitance or hasn't been using these tools,

00:00:18.879 --> 00:00:22.015
that you think could really stand to benefit from using SageMaker?

00:00:22.015 --> 00:00:24.054
The quick answer is no.

00:00:24.054 --> 00:00:30.420
Like what I've seen so far is that SageMaker has a use case for everyone, right?

00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:35.395
So we do work with companies from startups to very large enterprises.

00:00:35.395 --> 00:00:37.455
It was built by design.

00:00:37.454 --> 00:00:39.379
Startups for example, are very agile,

00:00:39.380 --> 00:00:42.965
they are very fast, they want to build products really rapidly.

00:00:42.965 --> 00:00:46.210
So they don't care too much about or they do care,

00:00:46.210 --> 00:00:51.649
but they don't worry too much about things like end-to-end encryption or security,

00:00:51.649 --> 00:00:56.164
and all these sort of regulations that can come around a platform of service.

00:00:56.164 --> 00:00:57.530
So we do see startups

00:00:57.530 --> 00:01:00.259
accelerating the process through which we're building and Training Machine,

00:01:00.259 --> 00:01:01.579
Learning Models in SageMaker.

00:01:01.579 --> 00:01:05.524
But we also work with large enterprises that are heavily regulated.

00:01:05.525 --> 00:01:07.865
We work with people in financial services.

00:01:07.864 --> 00:01:10.939
You know, the platform needs to be PCI DSS compliant.

00:01:10.939 --> 00:01:15.935
We work with people in health care where the platform needs to be HIPAA compliant.

00:01:15.935 --> 00:01:18.859
We worked with GDPR out there nowadays.

00:01:18.859 --> 00:01:22.849
So SageMaker, we really put a lot of energy into making sure that

00:01:22.849 --> 00:01:27.109
the platform is flexible enough to fit the needs of everyone in the ecosystem.

00:01:27.109 --> 00:01:31.549
Now the platform is ISO, PCI, GDPR,

00:01:31.549 --> 00:01:36.349
HIPAA and all of these huge compliance capabilities

00:01:36.349 --> 00:01:41.030
are injected into the product which makes people that are heavily regulated comfortable.

00:01:41.030 --> 00:01:43.939
But it's also like very flexible,

00:01:43.939 --> 00:01:46.234
a lot of examples, a lot of APIs,

00:01:46.234 --> 00:01:49.125
a lot of automation and which also makes

00:01:49.125 --> 00:01:56.090
entry-level learners or startups to just like jump on it and then accelerate.

00:01:56.090 --> 00:02:01.439
Now I would really encourage all sorts of learners

00:02:01.439 --> 00:02:02.929
like students for example with

00:02:02.930 --> 00:02:06.545
a Machine Learning NANO degree or Deep Learning NANO degree at Udacity,

00:02:06.545 --> 00:02:09.650
AWS provides AWS editing credits, right?

00:02:09.650 --> 00:02:14.000
So if you think about just jumping on the program and then getting

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:19.099
access to some credits in this jumping on SageMaker and playing not playing with a toy,

00:02:19.099 --> 00:02:21.919
it's the same Jupyter notebook that you have in your laptop.

00:02:21.919 --> 00:02:25.099
But then you get a possibility to use GPUs there

00:02:25.099 --> 00:02:28.310
and solve some deeper computer vision problems.

00:02:28.310 --> 00:02:34.055
So I don't really see a friction in the type of people that could use a platform.

00:02:34.055 --> 00:02:37.205
I've seen a lot of excitement from virtually people,

00:02:37.205 --> 00:02:38.240
everyone around the world

00:02:38.240 --> 00:02:42.560
Yeah. It's something where with the availability of

00:02:42.560 --> 00:02:47.599
GPUs and the availability of being able to label your own datasets,

00:02:47.599 --> 00:02:50.419
it's just really powering the research and the advancement.

00:02:50.419 --> 00:02:51.979
So I think these things are very tied.

00:02:51.979 --> 00:02:52.579
Exactly.

00:02:52.580 --> 00:02:52.930
Yeah.

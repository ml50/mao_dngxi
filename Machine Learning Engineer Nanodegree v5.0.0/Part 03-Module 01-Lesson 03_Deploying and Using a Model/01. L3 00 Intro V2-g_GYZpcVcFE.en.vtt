00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.634
Now you've had a chance to see some of the basics of what SageMaker can do for you.

00:00:04.634 --> 00:00:08.879
For the most part, we've looked at how SageMaker can be used in a lab like setting,

00:00:08.880 --> 00:00:12.285
where we're interested in exploring and processing data,

00:00:12.285 --> 00:00:15.300
creating models and then testing those models.

00:00:15.300 --> 00:00:18.630
Next, we're going to look at how SageMaker can help us deploy

00:00:18.629 --> 00:00:22.259
the models that we've created so they can be used outside of the notebook.

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:24.300
In addition, we're going to look at building

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:28.240
a simple web app that will interact with a deployed model.

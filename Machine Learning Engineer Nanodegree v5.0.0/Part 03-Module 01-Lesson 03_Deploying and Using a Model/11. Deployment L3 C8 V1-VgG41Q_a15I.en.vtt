00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.649
So, we've built a model,

00:00:01.649 --> 00:00:05.099
created a Lambda function that lets us interact with that model,

00:00:05.099 --> 00:00:07.740
and then created an API or

00:00:07.740 --> 00:00:11.759
an endpoint that allows us to send data to our lambda function.

00:00:11.759 --> 00:00:14.779
The last step is to actually launch our web app.

00:00:14.779 --> 00:00:18.539
To do that, we need to know the URL for the endpoint that we've created.

00:00:18.539 --> 00:00:21.329
If we go back to the API gateway page and select

00:00:21.329 --> 00:00:24.298
the API that we created in the last video,

00:00:24.298 --> 00:00:27.300
and then on the left-hand side click on "Stages," we can see

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:30.600
that there's the single stage we created last time, "prod."

00:00:30.600 --> 00:00:34.109
Selecting this gives us information about our API.

00:00:34.109 --> 00:00:35.850
In particular at the top here,

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:39.840
it tells us the URL that can be used to invoke the API.

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:41.595
So, let's copy this.

00:00:41.594 --> 00:00:48.784
If we now go to the "Notebook hub" where we originally opened up the web app notebook,

00:00:48.784 --> 00:00:52.339
you can see that there's an index.html file.

00:00:52.340 --> 00:00:55.465
Selecting the check box to the left,

00:00:55.465 --> 00:00:58.860
and then clicking on "Edit" lets us edit this.

00:00:58.859 --> 00:01:02.060
Now, you don't need to know how this webpage works,

00:01:02.060 --> 00:01:07.040
but what you do need to do is make sure you add the name of your deploy endpoint.

00:01:07.040 --> 00:01:08.750
This is an old one here, so,

00:01:08.750 --> 00:01:13.025
I can get rid of it and replace it with the new end point that we just created.

00:01:13.025 --> 00:01:15.830
Now that we've done that, we can save this file,

00:01:15.829 --> 00:01:19.295
close this page, and now if we open up this webpage,

00:01:19.295 --> 00:01:21.049
we'll be able to use our web app.

00:01:21.049 --> 00:01:25.004
For some reason, just clicking on this doesn't seem to work correctly.

00:01:25.004 --> 00:01:28.310
However, if I select the check box to the left and

00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:32.015
click on "Download," and then run it from my local computer,

00:01:32.015 --> 00:01:34.915
it does seem to work. I'll just zoom in.

00:01:34.915 --> 00:01:37.850
Now, we can submit some reviews to see

00:01:37.849 --> 00:01:40.640
whether or not our model thinks they're positive or negative.

00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:43.189
We'll start with a very positive review.

00:01:43.189 --> 00:01:45.709
Let's see what our model thinks of this review.

00:01:45.709 --> 00:01:47.494
It seems our model was right.

00:01:47.495 --> 00:01:49.495
Okay. How about a negative one?

00:01:49.495 --> 00:01:51.210
We can submit it to our model.

00:01:51.209 --> 00:01:53.384
So, our web app is now working.

00:01:53.385 --> 00:01:55.969
Since we don't really have any further use of our web app,

00:01:55.969 --> 00:01:58.775
we need to make sure to shut everything down.

00:01:58.775 --> 00:02:03.355
In particular, we need to make sure to shut down our deployed endpoint.

00:02:03.355 --> 00:02:08.129
Remember, the cost of an endpoint is based on how long it's running for.

00:02:08.129 --> 00:02:10.894
So, if you don't have a use for it, you need to shut it down.

00:02:10.895 --> 00:02:14.510
If we head back to the notebook and scroll all the way down to the bottom,

00:02:14.509 --> 00:02:17.405
we can delete our endpoint by executing this code cell right here.

00:02:17.405 --> 00:02:21.115
Of course, you can also use the console as I showed you in a previous video.

00:02:21.115 --> 00:02:23.335
In addition to shutting down the endpoint,

00:02:23.335 --> 00:02:25.670
you may wish to delete the lambda function that you

00:02:25.669 --> 00:02:28.444
created and delete the API that you created.

00:02:28.444 --> 00:02:31.449
To do that, heading back to the Amazon console.

00:02:31.449 --> 00:02:33.599
First, to delete the lambda function,

00:02:33.599 --> 00:02:35.884
select "Lambda" under the compute heading

00:02:35.884 --> 00:02:37.909
and you will see the lambda function that you created.

00:02:37.909 --> 00:02:41.990
Selecting this, clicking on "Actions" and going down to delete,

00:02:41.990 --> 00:02:44.590
will allow you to delete this lambda function.

00:02:44.590 --> 00:02:46.905
To delete the API that you created,

00:02:46.905 --> 00:02:48.854
go back to the Amazon console,

00:02:48.854 --> 00:02:52.229
scroll down to networking and content delivery,

00:02:52.229 --> 00:02:53.869
and select "API Gateway."

00:02:53.870 --> 00:02:57.259
Again, here you will see the API that you created.

00:02:57.259 --> 00:03:02.039
Select it, click on the "Actions" drop-down and select "Delete API."

00:03:02.039 --> 00:03:06.079
You'll need to type in the name of your API to confirm that you do want to delete it.

00:03:06.080 --> 00:03:08.480
That's how you can clean up all of the different resources that

00:03:08.479 --> 00:03:11.269
you used in order to launch your simple web app.

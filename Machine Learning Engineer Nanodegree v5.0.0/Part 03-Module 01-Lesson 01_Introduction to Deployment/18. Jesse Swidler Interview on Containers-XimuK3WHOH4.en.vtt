I'm Jennifer Staab, AI instructor at Eudacity.

00:00:03.375 --> 00:00:05.325
I'm speaking with Jesse Swidler.

00:00:05.325 --> 00:00:08.160
He is a Senior Software Engineer at Eudacity.

00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:10.425
Hi Jennifer, it's nice to be here today.

00:00:10.425 --> 00:00:12.630
Yeah I've been working on Web Applications for

00:00:12.630 --> 00:00:15.225
the last eight or nine years and I'm happy to talk to you today.

00:00:15.224 --> 00:00:19.140
So, Jesse, as your job as a Software Developer,

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:21.300
how do you find Containers useful?

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:24.480
Yeah. Well, I think the Shipping Container or

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:27.435
Analogy of Containers is

00:00:27.434 --> 00:00:31.320
really the best way to understand how Containers make our life easier.

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:33.914
Before there were Shipping Containers,

00:00:33.914 --> 00:00:37.519
it was very difficult to move things around the World versus now we can put

00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:41.630
everything in a nice little box and because they're all in the same box,

00:00:41.630 --> 00:00:45.240
we can attach them to a truck and drive them to a Shipyard

00:00:45.240 --> 00:00:49.505
and put them on a Ship or put them on a big boat.

00:00:49.505 --> 00:00:52.490
We can build big expensive tools,

00:00:52.490 --> 00:00:54.440
Cranes to move these boxes around,

00:00:54.439 --> 00:00:57.210
pick them up and put them different places.

00:00:57.820 --> 00:01:01.365
That's how Containers makes our life better.

00:01:01.365 --> 00:01:05.180
Everything becomes the same and we can develop tooling around that sameness.

00:01:05.180 --> 00:01:08.200
So, you're saying that using Containers

00:01:08.200 --> 00:01:11.689
in Software is similar to our Shipping Container Analogy?

00:01:11.689 --> 00:01:12.614
Yeah, yeah.

00:01:12.614 --> 00:01:14.959
It just makes life easier because you can have

00:01:14.959 --> 00:01:18.969
these tools that are developed for a specific Container,

00:01:18.969 --> 00:01:20.819
but it doesn't really matter what's in the Container,

00:01:20.819 --> 00:01:23.679
like it doesn't matter what Software we're running underneath?

00:01:23.680 --> 00:01:25.760
That's right Jennifer.

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:30.890
Or I've gone wrong, I've gone astray?

00:01:33.329 --> 00:01:37.614
So, Containers is not a full Virtual Machine,

00:01:37.614 --> 00:01:40.570
but for beginners, it's probably useful to think about it

00:01:40.569 --> 00:01:43.704
that way because you're sharing a Colonel with the underlying OS.

00:01:43.704 --> 00:01:46.500
So, since it's not a full Virtual machine,

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:50.769
what makes it Containers special or better that they're not?

00:01:50.769 --> 00:01:54.289
What are the advantages of not having them as a full Virtual Machine?

00:01:54.290 --> 00:01:56.530
Well, because they're not a full Virtual Machine,

00:01:56.530 --> 00:01:58.525
it's lighter weight on the OS,

00:01:58.525 --> 00:02:03.170
which means the applications can run with very low overhead.

00:02:03.170 --> 00:02:06.170
So, you don't pay a huge penalty for using the Container.

00:02:06.170 --> 00:02:11.879
So, can you tell us how we use Containers with the WorKspace in the Classroom?

00:02:11.879 --> 00:02:14.534
With Workspaces, most of

00:02:14.534 --> 00:02:19.444
the Student Environments are put inside of one of these Containers.

00:02:19.444 --> 00:02:23.069
Because of that, we can put the Containers in

00:02:23.069 --> 00:02:27.305
our Environment where they can be deployed to all of the students at the same time.

00:02:27.305 --> 00:02:31.040
We can control authorization to them in the same way.

00:02:31.039 --> 00:02:33.109
Just like with the Shipping Containers,

00:02:33.110 --> 00:02:39.190
we've built tools around exposing Containers for Students.

00:02:39.500 --> 00:02:42.069
Without the ability to do that,

00:02:42.069 --> 00:02:45.129
we wouldn't be able to make new Workspaces as easily.

00:02:45.129 --> 00:02:49.484
So, essentially, Workspace is run in Containers?

00:02:49.485 --> 00:02:52.124
Yeah. In and through Containers,

00:02:52.123 --> 00:02:55.905
all up and down the stack, we use Container.

00:02:55.905 --> 00:02:58.560
So, basically, when Students log on,

00:02:58.560 --> 00:03:01.634
they're using Workspaces, they're essentially using Containers?

00:03:01.634 --> 00:03:02.189
Yeah, yeah.

00:03:02.189 --> 00:03:05.900
So, they've already used Containers in there nano degrees already?

00:03:05.900 --> 00:03:08.960
Yeah, I mean very directly inside the Workspaces.

00:03:08.960 --> 00:03:10.895
But I mean more generally,

00:03:10.895 --> 00:03:12.305
every time you use the Internet,

00:03:12.305 --> 00:03:15.844
you're probably using Containers on a Server somewhere.

00:03:15.844 --> 00:03:17.705
Oh wow, that's really interesting.

00:03:17.705 --> 00:03:19.510
I never thought of it like that.

00:03:19.509 --> 00:03:25.804
So, what happens, like if we want to update Software in a Workspace,

00:03:25.805 --> 00:03:28.215
how does that affect things?

00:03:28.215 --> 00:03:30.509
Well, that's a good thing about Containers.

00:03:30.509 --> 00:03:35.659
Is we generally build them through build scripts and because of that,

00:03:35.659 --> 00:03:38.780
we can just update the script to use

00:03:38.780 --> 00:03:40.955
the new dependency and run it again

00:03:40.955 --> 00:03:43.505
and then we'll have a new Container with the updated Software.

00:03:43.504 --> 00:03:46.264
Wow that makes updating Software really easy.

00:03:46.264 --> 00:03:46.849
Yeah.

00:03:46.849 --> 00:03:51.259
So, how have Containers made your job as a Software Developer easier for you?

00:03:51.259 --> 00:03:54.229
Containers has really changed everything about the way

00:03:54.229 --> 00:03:57.544
I do my job because before I use Containers,

00:03:57.544 --> 00:04:00.634
it was difficult to split things up the way you want.

00:04:00.634 --> 00:04:04.079
Now, with Containers, most Software

00:04:04.080 --> 00:04:09.490
development for Web Applications is not via Microservices.

00:04:09.500 --> 00:04:14.685
We break things down in much smaller more manageable units.

00:04:14.685 --> 00:04:17.639
That make sense. So, it's made your life much easier?

00:04:17.639 --> 00:04:18.854
It really has.

00:04:18.855 --> 00:04:22.805
Well, thank you today for talking with us today.

00:04:22.805 --> 00:04:25.879
I really appreciate you talking to us about Containers.

00:04:25.879 --> 00:04:29.629
I feel like now I have a better understanding of Containers because I

00:04:29.629 --> 00:04:33.699
realize how they're connected to the Workspaces that we use at Eudacity.

00:04:33.699 --> 00:04:36.069
Thanks for talking with me.

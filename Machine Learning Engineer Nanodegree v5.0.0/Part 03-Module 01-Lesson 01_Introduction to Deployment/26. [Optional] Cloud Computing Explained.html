          Remember that most of the factors related to choosing
          <em>
           cloud computing services
          </em>
          , instead of
          <em>
           developing on-premise IT resources
          </em>
          are related to
          <strong>
           <em>
            time
           </em>
          </strong>
          and
          <strong>
           <em>
            cost
           </em>
          </strong>
          .  Below we have an example that explains
          <em>
           why
          </em>
          startups use cloud services.
         </p>
         <p style="margin-left: 25px">
          Imagine it’s 2010 and you created a photo-sharing application called *Instagram*.  Some challenges you face are you have little funding, few employees, and your application will need to scale to meet customer usage. Ideally, your application needs to scale to meet spikes in demand without having to put limits on application usage or the number of supported users. Because you’re unsure about how popular your application will be, you don’t want to spend funding to prepare for users you may not have. Instead, you want to spend those funds on advertising and extra features to attract more users.
         </p>
         <p style="margin-left: 25px">
          You’ve learned cloud computing provides ***pay-as-you-go*** service (*on-demand self service*), that can be available to anyone with ***wireless or internet connection*** (*broad network access*), and can ***scale up and down rapidly*** (*rapid elasticity*) to meet customer demand easily. These ***features*** of **cloud computing** make using cloud the *obvious* choice to launch your photo sharing application.
         </p>
         <p>
          While it may make sense why a startup like Instagram chose to use cloud services, it may be more perplexing why an
          <em>
           established
          </em>
          organization would consider incorporating cloud services into their infrastructure. Addressing these questions will provide you with information that will guide decisions you will make when
          <strong>
           <em>
            deploying
           </em>
          </strong>
          <em>
           machine learning models
          </em>
          within your workplace.

          Capacity Utilization Graph

         <p>
          To understand why an
          <em>
           established
          </em>
          organization would consider incorporating cloud services into their infrastructure, it’s important to understand the

            capacity utilization over time graph
           </em>

          below.  I’m going to explain this graph in detail to illustrate the business drivers and benefits of cloud computing for both
          <em>
           startups

          </em>
          associated with these IT resources. For traditional non-cloud infrastructures, this would include purchase and maintenance of these resources. For cloud infrastructures, this would only include paying for use of these IT services. Along the x-axis or horizontal axis of this graph is

          For understanding this graph, we are going to return to our Instagram example. Imagine this graph depicts the

          </strong>

          <em>
           traditional infrastructure

          We explain the graph in detail to demonstrate the benefits of cloud infrastructure. With
          <em>
           traditional infrastructure
          </em>
          , it takes a considerable amount of time to predict demand, obtain approval for
          <em>
           capacity
          </em>
          increase, purchase new resources, and install these resources. The graph below depicts this lag of time with how
          <em>
           traditional infrastructure
          </em>
          is increased to the level of predicted
          <strong>
           <em>
            future
           </em>
          </strong>
          demand. The point select is the time at which they would be able to increase traditional infrastructure again.
         </p>
         <p>
          If Instagram had decided to use
          <em>
           traditional non-cloud infrastructure
          </em>
          , they would have needed more capital to make the investment in
          <em>
           traditional infrastructure
          </em>
          and they would have needed to overestimate customer demand for
          <em>
           capacity
          </em>
          . This overestimation of customer
          <em>
           capacity
          </em>
          provides Instagram with the additional time needed to upgrade
          <em>
           traditional infrastructure
          </em>
          to meet an increasing customer demand.

          Using cloud computing has the benefit of
          <strong>
           <em>
            reducing investments and having costs proportional
           </em>
          </strong>
          to the usage of cloud services. Recall that cloud computing provides
          <em>
           on-demand
          </em>
          access to
          <em>
           pay-as-you-go
          </em>
          cloud computing services; therefore, reducing the necessity to invest in computational resources that will
          <em>
           not
          </em>
          be used. Additionally,
          <em>
           pay-as-you-go
          </em>
          services make using cloud resources proportional to their costs. This is illustrated by how
          <em>
           automated cloud capacity
          </em>
          can meet actual customer demand without
          <em>
           wasting capacity
          </em>
          nor having
          <em>

          between
          <em>

           </em>
          </strong>
          .  Additionally, there are also savings in removing the need to spend company resources on
          <em>

          </em>
          of customer demand.  This

          <em>
           automatic triggers
          </em>
          and the
          <em>

          Cloud services like Amazon’s SageMaker can be used for
          <strong>

          parts of the Machine Learning Workflow  (

          Cloud services like Google’s Cloud ML Engine are meant to be used primarily for

          Another common way to incorporate cloud into the machine learning workflow is to
          <em>
           only
          </em>
          use cloud computing services for
          <em>
           Deployment
          </em>
          (
          <strong>

          </strong>
          ). This might be a common strategy for organizations that are concerned about protecting the
          <em>
           privacy
          </em>
          of the data they used to create the model that was deployed. Additionally, organizations might host their web application or software application on cloud assets to allow for greater scalability and availability for less cost as offered by cloud services.

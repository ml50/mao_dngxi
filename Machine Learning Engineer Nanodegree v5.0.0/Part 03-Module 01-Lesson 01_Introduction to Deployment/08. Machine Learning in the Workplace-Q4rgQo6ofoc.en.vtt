00:00:00.110 --> 00:00:03.449
How you use machine learning at home or in

00:00:03.450 --> 00:00:06.569
school may differ to how it's used within the workplace.

00:00:06.569 --> 00:00:08.099
Maybe you've participated in

00:00:08.099 --> 00:00:11.564
a Kaggle model competition to practice your machine learned skills,

00:00:11.564 --> 00:00:14.625
or maybe you've used machine learning

00:00:14.625 --> 00:00:18.600
algorithms to determine the best model for your academic research.

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:20.730
For these examples, only complete

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:23.975
the first two components of the machine learning workflow.

00:00:23.975 --> 00:00:26.010
Specifically, the end wants

00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:29.700
the most ideal models determined based on performance measures.

00:00:29.699 --> 00:00:32.789
This differs from workplace usage because deployment is

00:00:32.789 --> 00:00:36.125
typically a critical part of machine learning in the workplace.

00:00:36.125 --> 00:00:41.314
Now, there are cases where deployment is included in personal and academic usage.

00:00:41.314 --> 00:00:46.159
For example, an academic research group has developed a model that

00:00:46.159 --> 00:00:51.454
predicts the locations risk of mosquito-borne illness with high accuracy rates.

00:00:51.454 --> 00:00:53.640
Because of the high accuracy rates,

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:57.500
these researchers received additional funding to build and

00:00:57.500 --> 00:01:01.649
maintain a web application that deploys their model.

00:01:01.649 --> 00:01:05.719
In this way, deployment of this web application can be used by

00:01:05.719 --> 00:01:10.200
health and government officials to prevent mosquito-borne illness epidemics.

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:13.630
For an example of personal usage deployment,

00:01:13.629 --> 00:01:17.179
you decide to create a smartphone application.

00:01:17.180 --> 00:01:23.050
Imagine you're creating a Magic 8-ball application that provides the user with yes,

00:01:23.049 --> 00:01:27.814
no or ask again answers to questions they ask the application.

00:01:27.814 --> 00:01:30.709
Suppose you design this application,

00:01:30.709 --> 00:01:33.059
so instead of providing a random answer,

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:36.409
the application asks the user a series of questions to

00:01:36.409 --> 00:01:40.094
determine the user's mood using sentiment analysis.

00:01:40.094 --> 00:01:41.780
Based upon their mood,

00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:45.385
your application provides the user with an answer to their question.

00:01:45.385 --> 00:01:50.760
In the workplace, it's quite common to use deployment with the machine learning workflow.

00:01:51.359 --> 00:01:55.670
Machine learning models are used within an organization's web or

00:01:55.670 --> 00:01:59.614
software applications per activities like fraud detection,

00:01:59.614 --> 00:02:03.694
recommender systems, risk assessment, or facial recognition.

00:02:03.694 --> 00:02:06.799
Each of these activities require new inputs to make

00:02:06.799 --> 00:02:09.729
a prediction based upon the deployed model.

00:02:09.729 --> 00:02:12.379
The organization want to monitor and update

00:02:12.379 --> 00:02:16.430
their deployed model to make sure it provides the best predictions over time.

00:02:16.430 --> 00:02:20.810
Now that we've learned how machine learning can differ when it's used in the workplace,

00:02:20.810 --> 00:02:23.879
we'll focus on deployment for the rest of this lesson.

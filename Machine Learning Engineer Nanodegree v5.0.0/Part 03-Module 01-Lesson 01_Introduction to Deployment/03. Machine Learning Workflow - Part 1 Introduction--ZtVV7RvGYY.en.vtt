00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.230
Imagine you're going to take part in a kaggle competition

00:00:04.230 --> 00:00:08.070
where you'll predict the median value of a home in Boston,

00:00:08.070 --> 00:00:11.050
Massachusetts using a provided dataset.

00:00:11.050 --> 00:00:13.320
To better understand this competition,

00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:15.720
let's take a closer look at the data.

00:00:15.720 --> 00:00:19.080
Here's some of the data that shows the average number of

00:00:19.079 --> 00:00:22.014
rooms in the house and that house's median value.

00:00:22.015 --> 00:00:25.199
It makes sense that the more rooms a house has,

00:00:25.199 --> 00:00:26.879
the more it will be worth,

00:00:26.879 --> 00:00:31.129
but there's some variance in the trend due to other factors.

00:00:31.129 --> 00:00:35.960
For this competition, we use data to train a model and predict

00:00:35.960 --> 00:00:41.075
the median value of a house given the number of rooms and other features of the house.

00:00:41.075 --> 00:00:43.400
Besides your competition submission,

00:00:43.399 --> 00:00:46.489
your ultimate goal is to deploy your train model to

00:00:46.490 --> 00:00:49.710
smart phone application that you've developed.

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:52.250
This application will allow users to discover what

00:00:52.250 --> 00:00:56.079
Boston houses are worth based upon the houses features.

00:00:56.079 --> 00:00:58.589
How might you approach this challenge?

00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:02.175
Well, a common approach is to use the machine learning workflow.

00:01:02.174 --> 00:01:06.149
We'll discuss this workflow and how to use next.

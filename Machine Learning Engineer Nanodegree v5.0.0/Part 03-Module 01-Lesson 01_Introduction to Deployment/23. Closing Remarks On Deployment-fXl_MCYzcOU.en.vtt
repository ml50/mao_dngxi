00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.660
With this lesson, you've learned quite a bit about deploying

00:00:03.660 --> 00:00:08.039
machine learning models within cloud environments. Great job.

00:00:08.039 --> 00:00:11.609
You initially learned that cloud computing can be simply thought

00:00:11.609 --> 00:00:15.869
of as transforming an IT product into a service.

00:00:15.869 --> 00:00:18.375
With our vacation photos example,

00:00:18.375 --> 00:00:21.539
we transformed storing our photos on an IT product,

00:00:21.539 --> 00:00:26.039
the flash drive, into storing them on a service like Google Drive.

00:00:26.039 --> 00:00:29.039
Ultimately our vacation photos will be stored in

00:00:29.039 --> 00:00:32.200
a Google data center instead of on our own device.

00:00:32.200 --> 00:00:34.079
While this provides benefits,

00:00:34.079 --> 00:00:37.179
like easy access and shareability of our photos,

00:00:37.179 --> 00:00:42.609
using the cloud service also carries security and privacy risks.

00:00:42.950 --> 00:00:47.955
You've learned how the machine learning workflow is used to build,

00:00:47.954 --> 00:00:52.259
train, evaluate and deploy models to a production environment.

00:00:52.259 --> 00:00:54.349
You discovered deployment is

00:00:54.350 --> 00:00:58.829
a critical part of the machine learning workflow in the workplace.

00:00:59.179 --> 00:01:03.590
You understand that deployment is simply making your model

00:01:03.590 --> 00:01:08.204
available for predictions through a software or web application.

00:01:08.204 --> 00:01:10.640
You also learned about the characteristics of

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:13.905
deployment and the technologies that are used for deployment.

00:01:13.905 --> 00:01:15.614
In the next lessons,

00:01:15.614 --> 00:01:17.989
you'll see how to implement these concepts you've

00:01:17.989 --> 00:01:21.280
learned to deploy your own machine learning models.

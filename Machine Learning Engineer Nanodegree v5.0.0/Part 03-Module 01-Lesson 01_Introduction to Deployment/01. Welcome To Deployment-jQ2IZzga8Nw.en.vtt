00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.625
Welcome to the Deployment section in the standard group program.

00:00:03.625 --> 00:00:06.509
I'm Jennifer Stub, an expert in cloud computing.

00:00:06.509 --> 00:00:10.484
My passion for cloud computing was ignited when I began using

00:00:10.484 --> 00:00:16.484
Amazon Web Services for genomic research at a pharmaceutical company in 2012.

00:00:16.484 --> 00:00:19.230
Using cloud computing services provide

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:21.870
secure supercomputing capability for

00:00:21.870 --> 00:00:25.960
big data analytics that I could build and manage alone.

00:00:25.960 --> 00:00:27.670
With this deployment section,

00:00:27.670 --> 00:00:30.400
you'll be developing, training, validating,

00:00:30.399 --> 00:00:35.039
and deploying machine learning models using Amazon SageMaker service.

00:00:35.039 --> 00:00:37.589
While you'll use SageMaker for deployment,

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:40.260
the skills you'll be learning are applicable to

00:00:40.259 --> 00:00:44.689
any production environment that aims to deploy machine learning models,

00:00:44.689 --> 00:00:47.015
and deep learning models with Python.

00:00:47.015 --> 00:00:49.490
We'll keep this lesson platform-neutral,

00:00:49.490 --> 00:00:52.510
we want to make sure that you get a good foundation in deployment.

00:00:52.509 --> 00:00:57.684
So, that you're able to apply this knowledge using any Cloud Platform in the future.

00:00:57.685 --> 00:01:02.980
With this lesson, we begin by providing you with an understanding of Cloud Computing.

00:01:02.979 --> 00:01:07.765
Next, the lesson we'll focus on how machine learning is typically used in the workplace.

00:01:07.765 --> 00:01:12.055
Deployment is a critical part of the machine learning workflow in the workplace.

00:01:12.055 --> 00:01:13.490
With this final lesson,

00:01:13.489 --> 00:01:17.359
we'll examine deployment, and how it fits within the machine learning workflow.

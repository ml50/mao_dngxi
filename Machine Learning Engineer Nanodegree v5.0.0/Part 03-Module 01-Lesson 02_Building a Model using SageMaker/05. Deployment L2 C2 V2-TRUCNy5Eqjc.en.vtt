00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.700
All right. To start using the SageMaker,

00:00:02.700 --> 00:00:06.375
the first thing we're going to need to do is set up a notebook instance.

00:00:06.375 --> 00:00:11.265
To do that, we need to sign into the AWS console, which I have done here,

00:00:11.265 --> 00:00:14.760
and then scroll down and underneath Machine Learning,

00:00:14.759 --> 00:00:17.655
we want to click on Amazon SageMaker.

00:00:17.655 --> 00:00:20.700
This will open up the SageMaker dashboard.

00:00:20.699 --> 00:00:22.589
From here on the left-hand side,

00:00:22.589 --> 00:00:25.530
we want to click on notebook instances.

00:00:25.530 --> 00:00:28.350
As you can see, I don't have any set-up currently.

00:00:28.350 --> 00:00:31.380
To make a new one, we click on this orange button in the top right corner

00:00:31.379 --> 00:00:34.500
that says Create Notebook instance.

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:36.435
Most of these settings are fine the way they are.

00:00:36.435 --> 00:00:40.370
However, we do need to name our notebook instance.

00:00:40.369 --> 00:00:44.759
I'm going to call mine deployment-notebook.

00:00:45.250 --> 00:00:48.725
We also need to make sure to set a role.

00:00:48.725 --> 00:00:51.189
A role acts like a security certificate,

00:00:51.189 --> 00:00:56.299
letting Amazon know what other resources are notebook we'll have access to.

00:00:56.299 --> 00:01:00.574
We need to make sure that we allow our notebook access to S3.

00:01:00.575 --> 00:01:05.245
To do that, we click on this drop-down and select Create a new role.

00:01:05.245 --> 00:01:08.385
The default selections will be perfectly fine.

00:01:08.385 --> 00:01:11.435
The most important line is the second one here that says

00:01:11.435 --> 00:01:16.865
any S3 bucket with SageMaker in the name can be accessed by our notebook.

00:01:16.864 --> 00:01:18.649
Since there are no additional buckets,

00:01:18.650 --> 00:01:22.315
we want to have our notebook access we'll select None here.

00:01:22.314 --> 00:01:25.019
A little later on, we'll talk about what S3 is.

00:01:25.019 --> 00:01:28.429
But, for now, just think of it as a place to store data,

00:01:28.430 --> 00:01:32.435
like training data, or maybe a trained model.

00:01:32.435 --> 00:01:36.025
Once we've done this, we click on Create role.

00:01:36.025 --> 00:01:40.144
The role has now been created and automatically assigned to our notebook instance.

00:01:40.144 --> 00:01:46.025
To finish it up, we just scroll down to the bottom and click on Create notebook instance.

00:01:46.025 --> 00:01:48.700
The status of our notebook instance is now pending,

00:01:48.700 --> 00:01:53.000
which means that Amazon is working away in the background to set everything up.

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:55.489
At this point, we just need to wait and

00:01:55.489 --> 00:01:58.414
Amazon has finished setting up our notebook instance.

00:01:58.415 --> 00:02:01.530
If we look under the status column now,

00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:04.799
it says that our notebook instance is inService,

00:02:04.799 --> 00:02:06.929
which means that it's running.

00:02:06.930 --> 00:02:10.430
Now, it's important to note that the default behavior

00:02:10.430 --> 00:02:14.754
is for a notebook to begin running once you've created it.

00:02:14.754 --> 00:02:18.169
It's important to know that because the cost of

00:02:18.169 --> 00:02:21.409
a notebook instance is based on the length of time that it's running.

00:02:21.409 --> 00:02:24.400
So, if you aren't going to be using your notebook,

00:02:24.400 --> 00:02:27.530
make sure to stop it and then start it again later.

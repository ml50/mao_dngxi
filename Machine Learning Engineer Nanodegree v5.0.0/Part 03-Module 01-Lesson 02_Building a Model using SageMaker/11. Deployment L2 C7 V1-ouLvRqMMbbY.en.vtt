00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.585
Now, you're going to get a chance to use SageMaker to build a model.

00:00:03.585 --> 00:00:05.219
To start with, open of

00:00:05.219 --> 00:00:09.870
sagemaker-deployment directory and then inside of that, the mini-projects directory.

00:00:09.869 --> 00:00:11.894
The notebook we're going to be working in is,

00:00:11.894 --> 00:00:15.599
IMDB Sentiment Analysis-XGBoost( batch transform).

00:00:15.599 --> 00:00:20.250
In this notebook, you're going to use SageMaker to create an XGBoost model,

00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:24.120
that we'll try determine whether a review posted on

00:00:24.120 --> 00:00:28.350
the Internet movie database is positive or negative.

00:00:28.350 --> 00:00:33.000
To begin with, step through the various cells that download the data,

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:36.149
prepare the data, and process the data.

00:00:36.149 --> 00:00:39.530
There isn't really anything for you to do here except execute the cells,

00:00:39.530 --> 00:00:41.435
and you should be warned that,

00:00:41.435 --> 00:00:44.510
the data processing can take some time,

00:00:44.509 --> 00:00:46.549
for me it took almost a full hour.

00:00:46.549 --> 00:00:49.969
So, I would recommend running all of the cells first,

00:00:49.969 --> 00:00:53.420
and then reading through to see what they're doing after the fact.

00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:56.515
Step four is where your work is going to begin.

00:00:56.515 --> 00:01:01.924
To start, you will break the training data set up into a validation and training set,

00:01:01.924 --> 00:01:07.094
then save the test training and validation sets to a file,

00:01:07.094 --> 00:01:09.784
and then upload those files to S3,

00:01:09.784 --> 00:01:13.459
just like we did in the Boston housing notebook.

00:01:13.459 --> 00:01:19.099
Then, you will create an XGBoost model, and fit it.

00:01:19.099 --> 00:01:24.359
Lastly, you will create a batch transform job to test the model,

00:01:24.359 --> 00:01:27.640
and take a look at how accurate your predictions are.

00:01:27.640 --> 00:01:31.400
Optionally, you can make sure to remove any files that were

00:01:31.400 --> 00:01:34.910
created in the data directory and the cache directory.

00:01:34.909 --> 00:01:37.534
This just makes sure that the disk drive

00:01:37.534 --> 00:01:41.119
on your notebook instance doesn't get filled up too quickly.

00:01:41.120 --> 00:01:45.320
I would recommend taking a look at the Boston housing notebook,

00:01:45.319 --> 00:01:47.750
as a lot of the things that we did there,

00:01:47.750 --> 00:01:52.340
are going to translate into the tasks that you want to do in this notebook.

00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:54.020
If you do get stuck however,

00:01:54.019 --> 00:01:55.849
don't worry because in the next video,

00:01:55.849 --> 00:01:58.599
I'm going to go through in detail my solution.

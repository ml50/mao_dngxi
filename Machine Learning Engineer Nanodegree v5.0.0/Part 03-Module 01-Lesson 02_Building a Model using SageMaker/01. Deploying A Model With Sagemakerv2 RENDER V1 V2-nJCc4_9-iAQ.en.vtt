00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.310
Hi, I'm Sean Carrell.

00:00:02.310 --> 00:00:07.320
In this lesson, I'm going to introduce you to Amazon's SageMaker service.

00:00:07.320 --> 00:00:09.150
By the end of this lesson,

00:00:09.150 --> 00:00:12.179
you should have an understanding of how SageMaker works,

00:00:12.179 --> 00:00:15.089
and you'll have had a chance to try it out yourself.

00:00:15.089 --> 00:00:18.629
To start, let's answer three big questions.

00:00:18.629 --> 00:00:21.454
What is it? Why use it?

00:00:21.454 --> 00:00:25.644
How does it work? First, what is SageMaker?

00:00:25.644 --> 00:00:31.259
Well, practically speaking, a SageMaker is a combination of two very useful tools.

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:35.414
The first is a managed jupyter notebook instance.

00:00:35.414 --> 00:00:39.144
This is the same jupyter notebook that you know and love,

00:00:39.145 --> 00:00:43.475
except instead of running in a workspace or on your personal computer,

00:00:43.475 --> 00:00:46.460
it runs on a virtual machine hosted by Amazon.

00:00:46.460 --> 00:00:48.649
As you've seen throughout this standard degree,

00:00:48.649 --> 00:00:52.879
notebooks give us a place to explore and process data and can be

00:00:52.880 --> 00:00:57.500
used to test ideas before needing more sophisticated and powerful machinery.

00:00:57.500 --> 00:01:01.070
The second tool provided by SageMaker is an API,

00:01:01.070 --> 00:01:02.719
which simplifies, some of them are

00:01:02.719 --> 00:01:06.334
computationally difficult tasks we might need to perform.

00:01:06.334 --> 00:01:09.500
Like, when want to train or deploy machine learning model.

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:11.495
So why use SageMaker?

00:01:11.495 --> 00:01:13.055
The simple answer is,

00:01:13.055 --> 00:01:18.280
that it makes a lot of the machine learning tasks we need to perform much easier.

00:01:18.280 --> 00:01:22.409
For example, in the machine learning workflow you looked at earlier,

00:01:22.409 --> 00:01:27.474
SageMaker provides tools to make each of the steps involved simpler.

00:01:27.474 --> 00:01:31.924
The notebook can be used to explore and process the data,

00:01:31.924 --> 00:01:36.435
and the API could help simplify the modeling and deployment steps.

00:01:36.435 --> 00:01:39.935
So how does SageMaker actually work?

00:01:39.935 --> 00:01:43.655
For the most part, when we talk about using sage maker,

00:01:43.655 --> 00:01:47.439
we really mean working in the managed notebook.

00:01:47.439 --> 00:01:51.189
This notebook has all of the benefits that we talked about before,

00:01:51.189 --> 00:01:55.254
with the added bonus of having access to the SageMaker API.

00:01:55.254 --> 00:01:59.409
The SageMaker API itself can be thought of as a collection of

00:01:59.409 --> 00:02:04.039
tools that deal with the training process and the inference process.

00:02:04.040 --> 00:02:07.310
The training process is exactly what you think it is.

00:02:07.310 --> 00:02:10.060
A computational task is constructed.

00:02:10.060 --> 00:02:15.094
Generally, this task is meant to fit a machine learning model to some data,

00:02:15.094 --> 00:02:18.125
then this task is executed on a virtual machine.

00:02:18.125 --> 00:02:21.379
The resulting model, such as the tree is constructed in

00:02:21.379 --> 00:02:24.715
a random tree model or the layers in a neural network,

00:02:24.715 --> 00:02:26.569
is then saved to a file.

00:02:26.569 --> 00:02:30.844
This saved data is called the model artifacts.

00:02:30.844 --> 00:02:35.030
The inference process is very similar to the training process.

00:02:35.030 --> 00:02:41.830
First, a computational task is constructed for the purposes of performing inference,

00:02:41.830 --> 00:02:45.710
then this task is executed on a virtual machine.

00:02:45.710 --> 00:02:47.540
In this case however,

00:02:47.539 --> 00:02:50.569
the virtual machine waits for us to send it some data.

00:02:50.569 --> 00:02:55.159
When we do, it takes that data along with the modal artifacts,

00:02:55.159 --> 00:02:57.139
which were created during the training process,

00:02:57.139 --> 00:03:00.019
and performs inference, returning the result.

00:03:00.020 --> 00:03:04.060
So that gives you a basic understanding of the SageMaker service.

00:03:04.060 --> 00:03:06.384
Before going into any more detail,

00:03:06.384 --> 00:03:10.299
let's actually use SageMaker to build our first model.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.970
Now, that our notebook instance is in service,

00:00:02.970 --> 00:00:06.675
we can click on Open to open up the Notebook Hub.

00:00:06.674 --> 00:00:09.269
Zoom in a little bit. All right.

00:00:09.269 --> 00:00:10.529
So, on the top here,

00:00:10.529 --> 00:00:13.799
you can see there's a tab that says, ''SageMaker Examples.''

00:00:13.800 --> 00:00:17.550
It gives you a bunch of notebooks that work through

00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:19.679
different examples of using SageMaker

00:00:19.679 --> 00:00:22.530
and I would certainly recommend that you take a look at some of those,

00:00:22.530 --> 00:00:24.510
if you'd like some additional resources.

00:00:24.510 --> 00:00:28.350
For now, though we're going to use git to download

00:00:28.350 --> 00:00:32.655
the notebooks for this module into our notebook instance.

00:00:32.655 --> 00:00:37.880
To do that, we click on New and open up a Terminal. All right.

00:00:37.880 --> 00:00:41.850
So, first we want to switch into the SageMaker directory,

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:43.634
which we'll do like this,

00:00:43.634 --> 00:00:47.899
and now what we want to do is clone the GitHub repository

00:00:47.899 --> 00:00:52.000
for this module into the SageMaker directory.

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:57.709
So, we do that by typing git clone and then the name of the repository which is

00:00:57.709 --> 00:01:06.685
https://github.com/udacity/sagemaker-deployment and there we go.

00:01:06.685 --> 00:01:09.710
Now, that we're done we just type exit and close

00:01:09.709 --> 00:01:13.009
the terminal tab and you can see that a directory has

00:01:13.010 --> 00:01:16.010
been added called sagemaker-deployment and inside are

00:01:16.010 --> 00:01:19.600
all of the different notebooks that we'll be going through.

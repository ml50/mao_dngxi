        In this capstone project, you will leverage what youâ€™ve learned throughout the Nanodegree program to solve a problem of your choice by applying machine learning algorithms and techniques. You will first
        <strong>
         define
        </strong>
        the problem you want to solve and investigate potential solutions and performance metrics. Next, you will
        <strong>
         analyze
        </strong>
        the problem through visualizations and data exploration to have a better understanding of what algorithms and features are appropriate for solving it. You will then
        <strong>
         implement
        </strong>
        your algorithms and metrics of choice, documenting the preprocessing, refinement, and postprocessing steps along the way. Afterward, you will collect
        <strong>
         results
        </strong>
        about the performance of the models used, visualize significant quantities, and validate/justify these values. Finally, you will construct
        <strong>
         conclusions
        </strong>
        about your results, and discuss whether your implementation adequately solves the problem.
       </p>
       <p>
        Think about a technical field or domain that you are passionate about, such as robotics, virtual reality, finance, natural language processing, or even artificial intelligence (the possibilities are endless!). Then, choose an existing problem within that domain that you are interested in which you could solve by applying machine learning algorithms and techniques. Be sure that you have collected all of the resources needed (such as data sets) to complete this project, and make the appropriate citations wherever necessary in your report.
       </p>
       <p>
        In addition, you may find a technical domain (along with the problem and dataset) as
        <em>
         competitions
        </em>
        on platforms such as
        <a href="http://kaggle.com" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">
         Kaggle
        </a>
        , or
        <a href="http://devpost.com" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">
         Devpost
        </a>
        . This can be helpful for discovering a particular problem you may be interested in solving as an alternative to the suggested problem areas above. In many cases, some of the requirements for the capstone project are already defined for you when choosing from these platforms.
       </p>
       <p>
        For whichever application area or problem you ultimately investigate, there are five major stages to this capstone project which you will move through and subsequently document. Each stage plays a significant role in the development life cycle of beginning with a problem definition and finishing with a polished, working solution. As you make your way through developing your project, be sure that you are also working on a rough draft of your project report, as it is the most important aspect to your submission!

       <h3 id="evaluation">
        Evaluation
       </h3>
       <p>
        Your project will be reviewed by a Udacity reviewer against the
        <strong>
         <a href="https://review.udacity.com/#!/rubrics/2541/view" target="_blank">
          Machine Learning Capstone project rubric
         </a>
        </strong>
        . Be sure to review this rubric thoroughly and self-evaluate your project before submission. All criteria found in the rubric must be
        <em>
         meeting specifications
        </em>
        for you to pass.

        Submission Files
       </h3>
       <p>
        At a minimum, your submission will be required to have the following files listed below. If your submission method of choice is uploading an archive (
        <code>
         *.zip
        </code>
        ), please take into consideration the total file size. You will need to include

         document as
         <strong>
          proposal.pdf

         ) addressing the five major project development stages. The recommended page length for a project report is approximately
         <em>
          nine to fifteen pages
         </em>
         .

You'll learn how to optimize your code, write tests and documentation for a code base, and build a Python package of your own. These skills are valuable in any engineering job and will act as a great foundation for applying machine learning skills in industry.\n\n### Machine Learning in Production\n\nIn this section, you'll learn about cloud services and model deployment. Deployment means making a model available for use in a piece of hardware or web application, such as a voice assistant or recommendation engine. In this lesson, you'll see how to analyze housing data and deploy a predictive model in SageMaker. In addition to learning about model deployment, you’ll also learn about model serving and updating. You'll learn how to connect a deployed model to a website through an API using AWS services. After deploying the model, you’ll update the model to account for changes in the underlying text data—an especially valuable skill in industries that continuously collect data. By the end of this section, you should have all the skills you need to train and deploy models to solve tasks of your own design!\n\n### Machine Learning, Deployment Case Studies\n\nIn partnership with AWS, we’ve created a course that examines a variety of machine learning models as they are applied, at-scale, to real-world tasks. You’ll learn how to deploy both unsupervised and supervised algorithms and apply them to tasks such as feature engineering and time series forecasting. This content addresses questions such as: \n1. How do you decide on the correct machine learning model for a given task?\n2. How can you utilize cloud deployment tools such as AWS SageMaker to work with data and improve your machine learning models?",

Recently, machine learning has been adopted by a wide range of industries, including medical diagnostic companies, finance and market prediction firms, and many more. Udacity’s Machine Learning Nanodegree program was built in response to this demand to provide access to this growing tech field to a broader audience.\n\nWe’ve seen advances in research and industry practices as more companies look to build machine learning products. **Specifically, there is a growing demand for engineers who are able to deploy machine learning models to global audiences**.  Also, machine learning engineers are often expected to work within larger software development teams. To keep up with this advancement and bring the best educational experience to our students, we have included content that includes:\n* Best practices for software engineering, and \n* The latest deployment skills, including deploying models at scale and updating models in response to changes in the underlying data.\n\nThese skills will set you apart from engineers who know only machine learning algorithms, but not the details of machine learning product development, at scale. So, I hope you're excited to learn even more!\n\n",

              "text": "### How to Ask a Good Question?  \n\nStudents that follow these tips typically receive the strongest initial support and avoid back-and-forth with mentors:   \n\n- __Ask Specific Questions__: if you have closely related questions that form part of a general theme, it’s okay to ask them all together. But consider using bullet points to separately list each of the questions in your post. Keeping your questions organized helps ensure mentors provide clear answers to each specific question. If your questions are less closely connected, it’s best to submit new, separate questions for each one.        \n\n\n- __Provide Details and Links:__ explaining what (if anything) you’ve already attempted to solve the problem helps mentors know where to start when answering your question. Likewise, if your question is not related specifically to a project, but rather to an exercise, quiz, or lesson, it’s helpful to include information such as lesson or quiz name, screenshots, and classroom links.  \n\n> Overall the key to asking a good question is to imagine yourself trying to answer your own question. Imagine you were coming to it without any prior knowledge. Does the question make complete sense? Or are there gaps around the context?    \n\n\n- __Start with a Clear Question Title__: attempt to summarize your entire question in one sentence. You may even write the title at the end, just before posting the question. This will help you summarize the issue before you include details in the question itself.      \n\n\n- __Share Code Correctly__:  by using the “Code Block” option to properly format your code. If your question concerns a piece of external code, include a link to the file on Github.    \n\n> In fact, Github lets you create a link to a specific line in a file.  To do so, just click to the left of the line number, and then select _copy permalink_ in the ellipsis that appears in the margin. Paste the _permalink_ right into the Github box on your question submission form.       \n\n\n- __Figuring out Errors__: if your question is about an error message or stack trace, include the entire error message, by either formatting the error message using the “Code Block” option or creating a Gist or a Paste on Pastebin, and including a link to it in the description.    \n\n\n- __Avoid Screenshots of Code or Error Messages__: do not use screenshots of code or error messages. They are hard to read and the text cannot be copied to debug it.   \n\n\n\nIf you receive a helpful answer, kindly select it as the “accepted answer.” For questions from other students, if you see other helpful answers kindly select the “upvote” option. Conversely, if you don’t think an answer strongly answers a question, select the “downvote” option. ",

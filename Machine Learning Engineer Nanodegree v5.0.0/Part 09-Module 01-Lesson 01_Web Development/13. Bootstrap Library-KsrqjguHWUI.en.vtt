00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.089
Just like how Python has libraries that make Python development easier,

00:00:05.089 --> 00:00:08.039
there are libraries built on top of CSS and

00:00:08.039 --> 00:00:10.989
JavaScript that make web development much easier.

00:00:10.990 --> 00:00:12.820
From this point on in the lesson,

00:00:12.820 --> 00:00:14.675
you'll only need to write HTML,

00:00:14.675 --> 00:00:17.214
Python, and a little bit of JavaScript.

00:00:17.214 --> 00:00:18.675
But behind the scenes,

00:00:18.675 --> 00:00:23.024
libraries will be taken care of the CSS and most of the JavaScript for you.

00:00:23.024 --> 00:00:25.570
First, let me remind you of the goal.

00:00:25.570 --> 00:00:28.495
You want to get a front-end that looks like this.

00:00:28.495 --> 00:00:34.579
In this video, I'm going to build up this front-end for you so you can see how I did it,

00:00:34.579 --> 00:00:37.600
and then you can practice doing it yourself in the exercise.

00:00:37.600 --> 00:00:39.375
For now, in this video,

00:00:39.375 --> 00:00:43.225
I'm just going to use images for the visualizations rather than

00:00:43.225 --> 00:00:47.524
the HTML visualizations that you're going to make later in the lesson.

00:00:47.524 --> 00:00:49.254
To make this front-end,

00:00:49.255 --> 00:00:51.304
I use the Bootstrap library.

00:00:51.304 --> 00:00:53.750
This is the Bootstrap homepage.

00:00:53.750 --> 00:00:56.634
The Bootstrap documentation is pretty good.

00:00:56.634 --> 00:00:58.225
There are many examples,

00:00:58.225 --> 00:01:00.175
and each example comes with code.

00:01:00.174 --> 00:01:03.859
Oftentimes, you can just copy and paste the example code

00:01:03.859 --> 00:01:07.590
from their website and then change the content to fit your needs.

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:09.920
That's exactly what I'm going to do here.

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:11.450
Going back to their homepage,

00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:13.960
I'm going to click on their Get started button.

00:01:13.959 --> 00:01:16.119
So, here on this page,

00:01:16.120 --> 00:01:20.765
there's actually a template that you can copy and paste as a starter.

00:01:20.765 --> 00:01:23.150
That's exactly what I'm going to do here.

00:01:23.150 --> 00:01:27.005
I'm going to copy and paste their starter code template.

00:01:27.004 --> 00:01:29.209
So far, it doesn't look like much.

00:01:29.209 --> 00:01:31.099
It just says, "Hello, world!"

00:01:31.099 --> 00:01:34.074
But let me explain what all of this code is.

00:01:34.075 --> 00:01:38.890
First of all, you have a doctype tag like what we discussed before,

00:01:38.890 --> 00:01:41.540
and then there's the HTML tag and it specifies

00:01:41.540 --> 00:01:44.250
in this case that the language of the website is English.

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:50.079
In the head tag, we've got things like these meta tags and then links.

00:01:50.079 --> 00:01:56.000
So, the first meta tag is just notifying the browser that the character set is utf-8,

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:59.944
and then the viewport meta tag is for

00:01:59.944 --> 00:02:05.500
shrinking and expanding the content for web versus mobile.

00:02:05.500 --> 00:02:09.875
Then, there's a link to the Bootstrap CSS library,

00:02:09.875 --> 00:02:11.849
then we have the title "Hello, world!",

00:02:11.849 --> 00:02:15.750
then the body starts where the bulk of your HTML content goes.

00:02:15.750 --> 00:02:20.175
Then, we have these links to all of these JavaScript scripts,

00:02:20.175 --> 00:02:23.990
and these are linking to jQuery essentially.

00:02:23.990 --> 00:02:28.159
Bootstrap uses jQuery to do some of its animations.

00:02:28.159 --> 00:02:32.449
The essential trick to using Bootstrap is that the screen is

00:02:32.449 --> 00:02:36.729
divided into these invisible rows and 12 columns.

00:02:36.729 --> 00:02:39.185
You can have as many rows as you want.

00:02:39.185 --> 00:02:44.229
Behind the scenes, Bootstrap is going to use CSS to make the layout happen for you,

00:02:44.229 --> 00:02:48.269
and all you have to do is specify IDs and classes.

00:02:48.270 --> 00:02:53.625
All of this is spelled out pretty explicitly in the documentation for Bootstrap.

00:02:53.625 --> 00:02:59.129
I'm going to show you a quick example of what all of these rows and columns look like.

00:02:59.129 --> 00:03:01.340
So, I'm going to erase this "Hello, world!"

00:03:01.340 --> 00:03:07.310
here, and then I'm going to add a div and give it the class of row,

00:03:07.310 --> 00:03:09.194
and then close that div.

00:03:09.194 --> 00:03:11.424
Inside of this row,

00:03:11.425 --> 00:03:17.960
I'm going to make a class called column-1 or col-1,

00:03:17.960 --> 00:03:20.270
and then we close this tag.

00:03:20.270 --> 00:03:23.370
I'm just going to write here C1.

00:03:23.370 --> 00:03:25.700
So, we have this column here, C1.

00:03:25.699 --> 00:03:30.375
I'm going to just copy and paste this so that there are 12 of them.

00:03:30.375 --> 00:03:33.590
So, hopefully, this makes it clear that this row

00:03:33.590 --> 00:03:36.969
is divided into 12 evenly spaced sections.

00:03:36.969 --> 00:03:38.460
Now, I'm going to make another row,

00:03:38.460 --> 00:03:40.520
and I'm just going to copy all of this again.

00:03:40.520 --> 00:03:45.420
So, now I have a second row with 12 evenly spaced columns.

00:03:45.419 --> 00:03:48.559
So, you have these 12 divisions to work with,

00:03:48.560 --> 00:03:50.455
but you don't need to use all 12.

00:03:50.455 --> 00:03:56.480
For example, I can say this first one is just four across and then the next one is eight,

00:03:56.479 --> 00:03:58.939
and then I'm going to erase all the rest of the ones.

00:03:58.939 --> 00:04:02.300
So, now you have a row that has one column that has

00:04:02.300 --> 00:04:05.665
four spaces and then one column that has eight spaces.

00:04:05.664 --> 00:04:08.139
So, for this next one, just to give another example,

00:04:08.139 --> 00:04:11.464
I'm going to give this seven and the next one five,

00:04:11.465 --> 00:04:14.280
and still everything adds up to 12 divisions,

00:04:14.280 --> 00:04:16.910
but you can see here on the right that

00:04:16.910 --> 00:04:20.689
the first part has seven divisions and the second part has five divisions.

00:04:20.689 --> 00:04:26.550
So, you can use these rows and columns to divide up the screen in any way you want to.

00:04:26.550 --> 00:04:28.949
If you go back to my web app,

00:04:28.949 --> 00:04:32.729
you can see perhaps how I've divided this up.

00:04:32.730 --> 00:04:37.550
So, this section on the bottom is just one big row,

00:04:37.550 --> 00:04:41.345
and then I've divided that row into a column

00:04:41.345 --> 00:04:45.545
of width one and another column here of width 11.

00:04:45.545 --> 00:04:52.663
Then, I've made another row within a column that has two columns,

00:04:52.663 --> 00:04:56.379
and then I made another row that also has two columns.

00:04:56.379 --> 00:04:59.379
I'm going to show you how this works with code as well.

00:04:59.379 --> 00:05:02.000
But let's build this up starting from

00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:05.889
the top with the navigation bar and then working our way down.

00:05:05.889 --> 00:05:08.930
I'm here back at the Bootstrap homepage.

00:05:08.930 --> 00:05:10.930
I'm going to click on Documentation,

00:05:10.930 --> 00:05:13.819
and then here I'm just going to search for navbar.

00:05:13.819 --> 00:05:19.115
So, on this page, there are a bunch of examples of how to make a navbar.

00:05:19.115 --> 00:05:22.620
So, all I did was I saw this one, I liked it,

00:05:22.620 --> 00:05:24.425
I copied this code,

00:05:24.425 --> 00:05:28.085
and then I paste it into my HTML.

00:05:28.084 --> 00:05:30.349
I'm going to erase all of this stuff on

00:05:30.350 --> 00:05:33.160
the bottom just so that it's easier to see what we're doing,

00:05:33.160 --> 00:05:39.310
and I'm going to change the website title to Data Dashboard.

00:05:39.310 --> 00:05:45.165
So, this navbar is pretty similar to the one that I have in my web app,

00:05:45.165 --> 00:05:46.980
but the colors are a little different,

00:05:46.980 --> 00:05:48.530
the links are a little different.

00:05:48.529 --> 00:05:51.619
So, all I have to do is just change those things.

00:05:51.620 --> 00:05:53.769
So, to change the color, for example,

00:05:53.769 --> 00:05:57.879
this says navbar-light here as a class,

00:05:57.879 --> 00:06:00.279
and I'm going to say navbar-dark.

00:06:00.279 --> 00:06:03.739
This bg-light stands for background light,

00:06:03.740 --> 00:06:05.764
I'm going to change to background dark.

00:06:05.764 --> 00:06:09.784
So, this is already looking more like the web page I have.

00:06:09.785 --> 00:06:12.485
Now, how did I know to change these classes?

00:06:12.485 --> 00:06:14.150
Well, it's all in the documentation.

00:06:14.149 --> 00:06:16.519
So, it shows you that you can change

00:06:16.519 --> 00:06:21.844
the navbar color and you can change the navbar shading using these different classes.

00:06:21.845 --> 00:06:27.890
Here, I put World Bank Data Dashboard,

00:06:27.889 --> 00:06:31.014
and then we also need to change these links here.

00:06:31.014 --> 00:06:35.784
So, the links are actually here in this HTML list.

00:06:35.785 --> 00:06:41.670
I'm going to say this first one is a link to the Udacity website,

00:06:41.670 --> 00:06:47.840
and so I need to change the h reference here to udacity.com,

00:06:47.839 --> 00:06:51.899
and then it has this span element in here that I don't actually want.

00:06:51.899 --> 00:06:55.444
So I'm going to delete that. So, we have this first one.

00:06:55.444 --> 00:07:01.154
Did you notice as well in this list here it says class="nav-item active"?

00:07:01.154 --> 00:07:03.059
I don't particularly want that,

00:07:03.060 --> 00:07:06.449
and that got rid of the white highlighting that it had.

00:07:06.449 --> 00:07:11.759
Now, I wanted to link to the World Bank Data.

00:07:11.759 --> 00:07:14.539
So, that showed up. Now, this pricing and disabled,

00:07:14.540 --> 00:07:16.625
we're not actually using, so we can delete them.

00:07:16.625 --> 00:07:18.745
Here we delete pricing,

00:07:18.745 --> 00:07:21.660
here we delete disabled,

00:07:21.660 --> 00:07:24.140
and this is looking pretty good.

00:07:24.139 --> 00:07:25.550
I'm going to expand this

00:07:25.550 --> 00:07:30.634
a little bit because that's the mobile view and this is the desktop view.

00:07:30.634 --> 00:07:33.435
So, actually, there is a little bit of a difference.

00:07:33.435 --> 00:07:36.980
This was right-aligned on my app,

00:07:36.980 --> 00:07:39.129
and here it's actually left-aligned.

00:07:39.129 --> 00:07:40.844
So, how can we change that?

00:07:40.845 --> 00:07:43.000
If you look it up in the documentation,

00:07:43.000 --> 00:07:47.464
you will find that if you add a margin with margin-left auto,

00:07:47.464 --> 00:07:48.799
you can actually change that.

00:07:48.800 --> 00:07:51.254
So, I'm going to add that into my code.

00:07:51.254 --> 00:07:54.079
You can see that it changed the alignment for me.

00:07:54.079 --> 00:07:57.919
Again, so the great thing about this library is

00:07:57.920 --> 00:08:01.759
that you just have to change the classes and IDs in all of your tags,

00:08:01.759 --> 00:08:04.430
and the CSS just gets taken care of for you.

00:08:04.430 --> 00:08:06.970
So, let's go back to the app.

00:08:06.970 --> 00:08:13.355
Like I said before, this bottom part here is made by nesting columns and rows together.

00:08:13.355 --> 00:08:17.569
So, I personally like to first write out the structure

00:08:17.569 --> 00:08:21.730
with all of the rows and columns and then fill those in. You don't have to do it.

00:08:21.730 --> 00:08:23.515
You can build it up little by little,

00:08:23.514 --> 00:08:25.224
but here's how I do it.

00:08:25.225 --> 00:08:32.300
So, down here, I know that I want everything to be inside of a row.

00:08:32.299 --> 00:08:34.129
Then, inside that row,

00:08:34.129 --> 00:08:38.240
I have a column of width one and I have

00:08:38.240 --> 00:08:44.639
another column of width 11 to fill out the rest of the space.

00:08:44.789 --> 00:08:49.259
Looking back at the dashboard, this is fine.

00:08:49.259 --> 00:08:50.870
We'll be able to do this now.

00:08:50.870 --> 00:08:56.565
This part in here actually has a row here and then another row,

00:08:56.565 --> 00:08:59.380
and each of these rows have two columns. So, let's put that in.

00:08:59.379 --> 00:09:04.985
We can add another row and another row.

00:09:04.985 --> 00:09:07.565
Then, within that row,

00:09:07.565 --> 00:09:13.075
I'm going to put two columns each of width six,

00:09:13.075 --> 00:09:16.565
and then I'm just going to copy and paste this.

00:09:16.565 --> 00:09:20.150
So, that's essentially the skeleton of the bottom part.

00:09:20.149 --> 00:09:23.044
So now, it's just a matter of filling things in.

00:09:23.044 --> 00:09:25.434
So, for this left-hand column,

00:09:25.434 --> 00:09:29.134
I am going to add links to LinkedIn and GitHub.

00:09:29.134 --> 00:09:31.965
So, here in href is where,

00:09:31.965 --> 00:09:35.435
say, you would put a link to your LinkedIn profile.

00:09:35.434 --> 00:09:40.764
Then, in the assets folder that you can see here on the left,

00:09:40.764 --> 00:09:42.985
I have put in a bunch of images,

00:09:42.985 --> 00:09:46.284
and I'm going to put those images into the web page.

00:09:46.284 --> 00:09:52.375
Specify an alt tag and close the link.

00:09:52.375 --> 00:09:54.465
Now, let's put in GitHub,

00:09:54.465 --> 00:09:59.310
and this is where you could put in the link to your GitHub profile in the href attribute.

00:09:59.309 --> 00:10:04.219
So, these images are pretty large and they're also touching each other,

00:10:04.220 --> 00:10:06.970
which is not exactly how I had it in the web app.

00:10:06.970 --> 00:10:09.065
So, in the documentation,

00:10:09.065 --> 00:10:12.710
you'll see that there's a class called img-fluid that will

00:10:12.710 --> 00:10:16.730
actually make these images shrink and expand in a nicer way.

00:10:16.730 --> 00:10:18.904
So, I'm going to add that class here.

00:10:18.904 --> 00:10:23.870
Now, you can see that these images grow and shrink with the size of the web page.

00:10:23.870 --> 00:10:27.259
I'm also going to add a couple of other things.

00:10:27.259 --> 00:10:29.629
For example, I put a border

00:10:29.629 --> 00:10:33.830
here on the right-hand side which I can add with the border-right class.

00:10:33.830 --> 00:10:35.395
It shows up right here.

00:10:35.394 --> 00:10:37.274
When the website is a little larger,

00:10:37.274 --> 00:10:39.584
you'll be able to see it better in a second.

00:10:39.585 --> 00:10:44.269
I'm also just going to add an extra div here on top.

00:10:44.269 --> 00:10:48.610
I'm going to add a class called mt-3;

00:10:48.610 --> 00:10:51.180
mt stands for margin top,

00:10:51.179 --> 00:10:57.625
and the -3 means that I want to add a margin of three.

00:10:57.625 --> 00:11:01.274
So, let's see what that looks like. It's getting better.

00:11:01.274 --> 00:11:06.019
So, I also added a little bit of space between these images,

00:11:06.019 --> 00:11:10.875
and I added a little bit of margin to the left of these images. So, let's do that.

00:11:10.875 --> 00:11:16.365
Here, I added a little bit of top margin to this image of the GitHub icon,

00:11:16.365 --> 00:11:19.039
and I'm going to add a little bit of left margin,

00:11:19.039 --> 00:11:23.179
and then I'm going to go into the LinkedIn class

00:11:23.179 --> 00:11:29.589
here and also add in a little bit of left margin.

00:11:29.590 --> 00:11:31.670
So this is looking a lot better.

00:11:31.669 --> 00:11:34.069
So, let's look at the web app one more time.

00:11:34.070 --> 00:11:36.930
So, we have these headers up here on top,

00:11:36.929 --> 00:11:40.474
the World Bank Data Dashboard: Top 10 World Economies Land Use,

00:11:40.475 --> 00:11:43.040
and then we have these four visualization.

00:11:43.039 --> 00:11:44.579
So, let's finish that up.

00:11:44.580 --> 00:11:47.905
This is in the column 11 class.

00:11:47.904 --> 00:11:49.605
So, here at the very top,

00:11:49.605 --> 00:11:53.745
I am going to add a h2 header,

00:11:53.745 --> 00:11:59.835
and I'm going to call it World Bank Data Dashboard.

00:11:59.835 --> 00:12:04.285
Then I had an h4 header below it,

00:12:04.284 --> 00:12:12.164
and I said Top 10 World Economies Land Use and then close that tag.

00:12:12.164 --> 00:12:15.814
Now, this looks a little bit different because I made this a gray color.

00:12:15.815 --> 00:12:17.255
Again, in the documentation,

00:12:17.254 --> 00:12:20.225
it talks about the classes you need to use to change the color.

00:12:20.225 --> 00:12:24.889
In this case, the class I used was called text-muted.

00:12:24.889 --> 00:12:27.365
We're looking good, we're getting close.

00:12:27.365 --> 00:12:29.769
Now, it's just a matter of filling in

00:12:29.769 --> 00:12:33.004
these images with the visualizations into each section.

00:12:33.004 --> 00:12:36.929
So here, I specify that the image should be fluid,

00:12:36.929 --> 00:12:40.164
and then I specify the actual image.

00:12:40.164 --> 00:12:42.610
Let's see how that looks.

00:12:42.610 --> 00:12:46.750
Now, I'm just going to copy and paste this and put it into

00:12:46.750 --> 00:12:51.549
the next column and change the name of the file to plot2,

00:12:51.549 --> 00:12:57.669
and then I'm going to add the next image and call that plot3,

00:12:57.669 --> 00:13:00.459
then I'm just going to copy in the code for

00:13:00.460 --> 00:13:06.389
the final image and call that plot4, and that is it.

00:13:06.389 --> 00:13:12.254
Now, we have something that looks pretty similar to the web app up here.

00:13:12.254 --> 00:13:16.639
That's how I built the front-end for this web app.

00:13:16.639 --> 00:13:21.218
The only thing left is to put an actual HTML,

00:13:21.219 --> 00:13:25.365
JavaScript visualizations rather than just using images,

00:13:25.365 --> 00:13:28.659
and you're going to do that with the Plotly library.

00:13:28.659 --> 00:13:31.745
But before getting into the Plotly library,

00:13:31.745 --> 00:13:35.200
there's an exercise for you to practice using Bootstrap.

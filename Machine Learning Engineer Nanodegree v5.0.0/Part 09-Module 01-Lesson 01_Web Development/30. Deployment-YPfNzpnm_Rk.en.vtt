00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.404
Up until now, you've been developing the web app

00:00:03.404 --> 00:00:06.844
in the classroom or on your local computer.

00:00:06.844 --> 00:00:10.775
However, you can't share the app yet with other people,

00:00:10.775 --> 00:00:14.940
unless you transfer all the files to someone else's computer then have

00:00:14.939 --> 00:00:19.170
that person setup a Python environment on his or her local computer.

00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:21.420
So, now it's time to deploy the app to

00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:26.140
an external server with a web address that anyone can go to to see your work.

00:00:26.140 --> 00:00:30.785
There are a lot of companies that provide web servers for deploying a web app.

00:00:30.785 --> 00:00:33.679
In this video, I've chosen to use Heroku,

00:00:33.679 --> 00:00:37.079
which is considered a Platform as a Service.

00:00:37.079 --> 00:00:39.979
In my opinion, it's one of the easier platforms

00:00:39.979 --> 00:00:43.125
to use and doesn't require much configuration.

00:00:43.125 --> 00:00:46.429
There's also a free tier that doesn't expire.

00:00:46.429 --> 00:00:49.429
So, if you have a small web app like this one,

00:00:49.429 --> 00:00:51.200
that doesn't have a database,

00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:54.109
Heroku will work for our needs.

00:00:54.109 --> 00:00:57.460
I'm going to walk you through getting the app up on Heroku,

00:00:57.460 --> 00:00:59.005
so that you can do it yourself.

00:00:59.005 --> 00:01:02.209
I'm going to do it from the classroom Linux workspace.

00:01:02.209 --> 00:01:05.295
I'll also provide a list, underneath the video,

00:01:05.295 --> 00:01:09.299
of other services you can use to put the web app on.

00:01:09.299 --> 00:01:12.795
Okay. So, this is our web app.

00:01:12.795 --> 00:01:17.180
All of the folders and files are here in the left-hand column.

00:01:17.180 --> 00:01:19.910
My first step is, I'm going to make

00:01:19.909 --> 00:01:24.439
a new folder and I'm going to put all of these files into that new folder.

00:01:24.439 --> 00:01:26.439
I'm going to do this from the terminal,

00:01:26.439 --> 00:01:29.299
but you could also do this using the plus sign and

00:01:29.299 --> 00:01:32.894
also right-clicking on these folders and files here.

00:01:32.894 --> 00:01:34.819
So, I open a new terminal,

00:01:34.819 --> 00:01:36.759
and I'm just going to say,

00:01:36.760 --> 00:01:39.829
make directory, and I'll call it web_app.

00:01:39.829 --> 00:01:45.140
Now, I'm going to move all of these folders and files into this new web app folder.

00:01:45.140 --> 00:01:47.605
So, MV is for move,

00:01:47.605 --> 00:01:53.040
-t just means I'm specifying the new directory first and then after that,

00:01:53.040 --> 00:02:00.460
all of the files and folders that I want to move into the web app folder.

00:02:00.730 --> 00:02:04.270
It looks like I spelled worldbankapp wrong.

00:02:04.269 --> 00:02:06.414
So let me just fix that.

00:02:06.415 --> 00:02:10.974
So, you can see, everything moved over into this new folder.

00:02:10.974 --> 00:02:15.069
So, in order to install this web app,

00:02:15.069 --> 00:02:19.219
we're going to have to specify all the python libraries that are needed.

00:02:19.219 --> 00:02:20.805
Now, in this workspace,

00:02:20.805 --> 00:02:22.879
and probably on your local computer as well,

00:02:22.879 --> 00:02:24.034
there are a lot of

00:02:24.034 --> 00:02:29.439
extra Python libraries installed that you don't actually need for your web app.

00:02:29.439 --> 00:02:34.444
So, we're going to deal with this by creating a virtual environment and just

00:02:34.444 --> 00:02:37.189
installing all the Python libraries we

00:02:37.189 --> 00:02:40.710
need for this particular app into the virtual environment.

00:02:40.710 --> 00:02:44.159
Now, this workspace has Anaconda installed,

00:02:44.159 --> 00:02:48.299
which is a set of tools used for Python and data science.

00:02:48.300 --> 00:02:51.325
There's actually an issue with

00:02:51.324 --> 00:02:56.289
the Anaconda installation and Python and virtual environments.

00:02:56.289 --> 00:02:58.509
So, first before doing anything,

00:02:58.509 --> 00:03:02.729
you need to run conda update python,

00:03:02.729 --> 00:03:04.844
and this is going to take a little while.

00:03:04.844 --> 00:03:09.594
Now, if you don't have Conda installed on your local computer,

00:03:09.594 --> 00:03:11.680
you wouldn't have to do this step.

00:03:11.680 --> 00:03:14.415
Okay. And when it says Proceed click

00:03:14.414 --> 00:03:20.014
yes and hit Enter and then wait for the installation to finish.

00:03:20.014 --> 00:03:23.079
Okay. Now that Python is updated.

00:03:23.080 --> 00:03:27.025
You can actually make a virtual environment and then start it up.

00:03:27.025 --> 00:03:29.569
So, to make a virtual environment,

00:03:29.569 --> 00:03:32.204
go into the terminal and type the following,

00:03:32.205 --> 00:03:39.630
python3 -n venv, and then the name of your virtual environment,

00:03:39.629 --> 00:03:41.019
which can be anything you want,

00:03:41.020 --> 00:03:43.980
I'm going to call it worldbankenv.

00:03:44.740 --> 00:03:48.260
Now, you can see there's a new folder up here on the left called

00:03:48.259 --> 00:03:53.039
worldbankenv and inside it's actually a Python installation.

00:03:53.039 --> 00:03:57.099
That's separate from the rest of your Python installation on your computer.

00:03:57.099 --> 00:04:01.090
The next thing is that you need to activate the virtual environment.

00:04:01.090 --> 00:04:04.569
So, I'm going to type in source worldbankenv/bin/activate,

00:04:08.039 --> 00:04:12.750
and you can see that the virtual environment is activated,

00:04:12.750 --> 00:04:14.155
because here in the terminal,

00:04:14.155 --> 00:04:16.720
now the name of the virtual environment appears.

00:04:16.720 --> 00:04:19.220
Okay. The next step is that we're going to pip

00:04:19.220 --> 00:04:22.970
install the libraries we need for our Flask app.

00:04:22.970 --> 00:04:25.550
So, again, the reason we're creating

00:04:25.550 --> 00:04:29.329
this virtual environment is that all these libraries are going to

00:04:29.329 --> 00:04:31.909
be installed in the virtual environment instead of

00:04:31.910 --> 00:04:36.000
the regular Python installation on your local computer.

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:38.779
So, pip install.

00:04:38.779 --> 00:04:42.544
Then I'm going to list out all of the libraries I need,

00:04:42.545 --> 00:04:46.475
which in this case is Flask, Pandas and Plotly.

00:04:46.475 --> 00:04:50.410
And then I'm actually going to add in this other library called

00:04:50.410 --> 00:04:57.140
Gunicorn which we're going to need for deploying the web app.

00:04:57.139 --> 00:04:59.154
Okay. Now from the terminal,

00:04:59.154 --> 00:05:02.500
I am going to go into the web app folder.

00:05:02.500 --> 00:05:08.240
The next step is to actually install a set of tools that Heroku provides,

00:05:08.240 --> 00:05:14.375
so that you can write commands and upload your app directly from the terminal to Heroku.

00:05:14.375 --> 00:05:17.149
There's actually a web page that tells

00:05:17.149 --> 00:05:20.049
you how to install these tools on different systems.

00:05:20.050 --> 00:05:22.235
This is what it looks like here.

00:05:22.235 --> 00:05:24.944
I'll also put a link to it below the video.

00:05:24.944 --> 00:05:26.735
But on this page,

00:05:26.735 --> 00:05:31.889
it says if you're on a Linux system or Ubuntu system, which we are,

00:05:31.889 --> 00:05:34.629
then you're going to do the following,

00:05:34.629 --> 00:05:42.759
you go into terminal and you run the following command up here.

00:05:42.759 --> 00:05:47.449
Now it's installing. Just to check that everything installed,

00:05:47.449 --> 00:05:51.935
I'm going to type heroku --version.

00:05:51.935 --> 00:05:54.845
Okay. So, it looks like it installed and we're good.

00:05:54.845 --> 00:05:59.250
The next thing you're going to want to do is to sign up for a Heroku account.

00:05:59.250 --> 00:06:02.209
So, it's just like signing up for any other web service.

00:06:02.209 --> 00:06:11.669
If you go to the Heroku website and you click on Sign up here in the top right corner,

00:06:11.670 --> 00:06:14.020
you just fill this out with your information.

00:06:14.019 --> 00:06:16.839
So, once you've made a username,

00:06:16.839 --> 00:06:19.919
which is just your email address and a password,

00:06:19.920 --> 00:06:23.645
you actually need to log in from the command line.

00:06:23.644 --> 00:06:26.509
So, now that we have the Heroku tools installed,

00:06:26.509 --> 00:06:32.000
you can type heroku login and it says "Enter your login credentials",

00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:35.209
email and then it's asking after that for a password.

00:06:35.209 --> 00:06:39.974
So, I'm going to hide this from the screen while I put this information in.

00:06:39.975 --> 00:06:43.480
Okay. So, now I'm logged into my Heroku account.

00:06:43.480 --> 00:06:45.230
Again, it's just a matter of putting in

00:06:45.230 --> 00:06:49.825
your email address and your password for your Heroku account.

00:06:49.824 --> 00:06:53.899
Now, there's just some housekeeping to do before we can

00:06:53.899 --> 00:06:58.444
upload all of this to a Heroku web server.

00:06:58.444 --> 00:07:02.750
So, first of all, I'm going to open worldbank.py and I'm

00:07:02.750 --> 00:07:07.310
going to remove this app.run line because we don't need this anymore.

00:07:07.310 --> 00:07:10.245
I also need to create a Procfile,

00:07:10.245 --> 00:07:15.350
which is a file that tells Heroku what to do when starting your web app.

00:07:15.350 --> 00:07:21.870
You could do this up here by creating a new file or you can do it in the terminal and say

00:07:21.870 --> 00:07:28.939
touch Procfile and you can see that this Procfile disappeared here in the left hand side.

00:07:28.939 --> 00:07:32.240
I'm going to double click to open it and then I'm going to

00:07:32.240 --> 00:07:36.835
say web gunicorn worldbank:app.

00:07:36.834 --> 00:07:41.339
So, this is essentially just says when starting up the web app,

00:07:41.339 --> 00:07:45.289
call the gunicorn library and run

00:07:45.290 --> 00:07:52.444
my worldbank app which has this app variable in it, which we've seen before.

00:07:52.444 --> 00:07:54.529
The next thing I need to do is

00:07:54.529 --> 00:07:58.064
specify all of the Python libraries that are going to be needed.

00:07:58.064 --> 00:08:03.219
So, if you type pip freeze into the terminal,

00:08:03.220 --> 00:08:08.300
it's going to give you a list of all of the currently installed Python libraries.

00:08:08.300 --> 00:08:10.730
So, you're going to need to put all of

00:08:10.730 --> 00:08:14.265
this information into a file called requirements.txt.

00:08:14.264 --> 00:08:22.254
So, I'm going to say pip freeze &gt; requirements.txt.

00:08:22.254 --> 00:08:26.944
That's going to put all this information into a file called requirements.txt.

00:08:26.944 --> 00:08:29.569
It's important that this file is actually called

00:08:29.569 --> 00:08:32.559
requirementstxt because Heroku is going to look for this file.

00:08:32.559 --> 00:08:40.824
So, you can see it just lists out all of the Python libraries that this app depends on.

00:08:40.825 --> 00:08:45.645
The next step is to initiate a git repository.

00:08:45.644 --> 00:08:53.319
So, git init and then git add and then I put the period here.

00:08:53.320 --> 00:09:00.690
Then I'm going to say git commit -m and say first commit as the message.

00:09:00.690 --> 00:09:03.380
Okay. It says that Please tell me who you are.

00:09:03.379 --> 00:09:05.779
You have to configure an email address and a name.

00:09:05.779 --> 00:09:10.759
So, you can actually put anything in this that you want.

00:09:10.759 --> 00:09:19.850
I'm just going to say something@example.com and git config user.name.

00:09:19.850 --> 00:09:22.840
You can put your real things in here if you want. My name's Andrew.

00:09:22.840 --> 00:09:26.080
So, okay, now let's try committing again,

00:09:26.080 --> 00:09:29.370
git commit -m first commit.

00:09:29.370 --> 00:09:31.435
Okay. So, we made our first commit.

00:09:31.434 --> 00:09:37.369
The last step is to create a web app on Heroku.

00:09:37.370 --> 00:09:38.440
So, to do that,

00:09:38.440 --> 00:09:43.825
you say heroku create and then the name of your web app.

00:09:43.825 --> 00:09:46.009
This name has to be distinct.

00:09:46.009 --> 00:09:49.485
There can only be one of these names on all of Heroku.

00:09:49.485 --> 00:09:51.529
So, if the first one you try doesn't work,

00:09:51.529 --> 00:09:53.459
just keep trying until you find something.

00:09:53.460 --> 00:09:56.370
So, I'm going to call this dsnd-udacity-webapp.

00:09:57.620 --> 00:10:03.889
Hit Enter. Okay. So, it gave me the link where I can see the web app,

00:10:03.889 --> 00:10:06.399
and then it also created a git repository on

00:10:06.399 --> 00:10:11.610
Heroku where the files are actually going to be uploaded to and stored.

00:10:11.610 --> 00:10:13.759
I'm also, just to double-check,

00:10:13.759 --> 00:10:17.240
I'm going to say git remote -v. Yeah.

00:10:17.240 --> 00:10:19.955
Which shows you that Heroku automatically

00:10:19.955 --> 00:10:24.055
set up these git repositories as remote repositories for you.

00:10:24.054 --> 00:10:26.014
So, the last step is to say

00:10:26.014 --> 00:10:34.514
git push heroku master and that's going to push our app to that Heroku git repository.

00:10:34.514 --> 00:10:39.600
Okay. Here, it says that everything was deployed to this web address.

00:10:39.600 --> 00:10:41.274
So, I'm going to click on that.

00:10:41.274 --> 00:10:43.629
Yeah. It looks like the web app deployed.

00:10:43.629 --> 00:10:51.779
So, now it's officially at this web address: dsnd-udacity-webapp.herokuapp.com.

00:10:51.779 --> 00:10:57.529
So, that is one way to deploy a Flask app to the web.

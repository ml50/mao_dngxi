00:00:06.019 --> 00:00:09.059
Throughout the lesson, you'll be introduced to

00:00:09.060 --> 00:00:12.245
each part of the application piece by piece.

00:00:12.244 --> 00:00:15.214
You'll start with the basic building blocks of a Web app,

00:00:15.214 --> 00:00:18.265
HTML, CSS and JavaScript.

00:00:18.265 --> 00:00:23.045
Then, you'll practice using two libraries that make Web development easier.

00:00:23.045 --> 00:00:25.440
The first library is called Bootstrap,

00:00:25.440 --> 00:00:28.865
and you can use it to quickly build the design and layout of your app.

00:00:28.864 --> 00:00:31.229
The second library is called Plotly,

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:34.100
which uses JavaScript to make visualizations.

00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:36.109
At this point in the lesson you'll have

00:00:36.109 --> 00:00:39.640
a functioning web page that includes data visualizations.

00:00:39.640 --> 00:00:44.159
However, the Web page will only be on your local computer not the Internet.

00:00:44.159 --> 00:00:49.174
The last part of the lesson focuses on getting the application ready for the Internet.

00:00:49.174 --> 00:00:52.339
You'll work with a Python Web framework called Flask,

00:00:52.340 --> 00:00:56.130
which takes care of the application logic happening behind the scenes,

00:00:56.130 --> 00:00:59.210
and finally you'll put all of these tools together and

00:00:59.210 --> 00:01:02.399
deploy your Web app to a website that anyone can access.

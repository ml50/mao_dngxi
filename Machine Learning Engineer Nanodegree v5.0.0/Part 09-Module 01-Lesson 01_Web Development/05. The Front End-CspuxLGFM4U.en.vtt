00:00:06.290 --> 00:00:08.818
In the next part of the lesson,

00:00:08.819 --> 00:00:10.560
you'll code the front-end.

00:00:10.560 --> 00:00:13.519
You'll start working with the three languages needed to code

00:00:13.519 --> 00:00:17.605
a webpage: HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

00:00:17.605 --> 00:00:21.120
As a reminder, HTML controls the content,

00:00:21.120 --> 00:00:23.200
CSS is in charge of style,

00:00:23.199 --> 00:00:25.869
and JavaScript takes care of interactivity.

00:00:25.870 --> 00:00:28.870
I want to emphasize that this part of the lesson will

00:00:28.870 --> 00:00:31.984
be a brief overview of these three languages.

00:00:31.984 --> 00:00:34.604
In reality, it can take a few weeks,

00:00:34.604 --> 00:00:37.250
if not months, to really learn them.

00:00:37.250 --> 00:00:41.140
You could code the front-end of a data dashboard including

00:00:41.140 --> 00:00:45.350
visualizations using only these three languages and nothing else.

00:00:45.350 --> 00:00:49.518
However, you are an intelligent busy data scientist

00:00:49.518 --> 00:00:53.074
and there's no reason to do everything from scratch.

00:00:53.075 --> 00:00:56.775
Once you've seen the basics of how to build a webpage,

00:00:56.774 --> 00:01:00.769
I'll introduce you to a front-end framework called Bootstrap.

00:01:00.770 --> 00:01:04.490
Bootstrap helps you make professional looking websites rather

00:01:04.489 --> 00:01:08.780
quickly because a lot of the CSS is taken care of for you.

00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:13.665
Finally, you'll work with a JavaScript library called Plotly.

00:01:13.665 --> 00:01:17.150
Plotly makes adding data visualizations relatively

00:01:17.150 --> 00:01:20.770
easy although it does take some time to get used to the syntax.

00:01:20.769 --> 00:01:22.295
With all this in mind,

00:01:22.295 --> 00:01:24.280
let's start building the front-end.

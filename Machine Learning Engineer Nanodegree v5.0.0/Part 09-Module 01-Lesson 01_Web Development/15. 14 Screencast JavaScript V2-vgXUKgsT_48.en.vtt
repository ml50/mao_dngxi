00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.674
JavaScript is the language that makes websites interactive.

00:00:03.674 --> 00:00:07.650
If you've ever been on a website that automatically updates content,

00:00:07.650 --> 00:00:09.300
JavaScript was doing that.

00:00:09.300 --> 00:00:11.660
Anything like a fade-in or a popup,

00:00:11.660 --> 00:00:13.265
those are done with JavaScript.

00:00:13.265 --> 00:00:15.115
To build the data dashboard,

00:00:15.115 --> 00:00:17.769
you won't need to actually write any JavaScript,

00:00:17.769 --> 00:00:21.269
but both the Bootstrap library that you'll use for CSS and

00:00:21.269 --> 00:00:25.259
the Plotly library that you'll use for making charts used JavaScript.

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:29.175
So, this will give you an idea of how these libraries actually work.

00:00:29.175 --> 00:00:32.380
Here's a basic toy example of JavaScript.

00:00:32.380 --> 00:00:34.640
In lines eight through 12 of the code,

00:00:34.640 --> 00:00:39.134
I've written a function that changes the header text when I click on the image.

00:00:39.134 --> 00:00:40.684
Let's see how it works.

00:00:40.685 --> 00:00:42.109
So, I go onto the page,

00:00:42.109 --> 00:00:43.549
I click the image,

00:00:43.549 --> 00:00:46.945
and you'll notice up here that the h1 tag text changed.

00:00:46.945 --> 00:00:49.820
Here are a few things of note about this code.

00:00:49.820 --> 00:00:53.600
First, the JavaScript code goes between script's tags.

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:57.020
Notice as well that I added an on-click attribute

00:00:57.020 --> 00:01:00.525
to the image tag and specified the function in.

00:01:00.524 --> 00:01:04.280
That's down here in line 28.

00:01:04.579 --> 00:01:11.299
Also, the JavaScript syntax to me at least is a bit funny looking.

00:01:11.299 --> 00:01:16.719
JavaScript has a relatively complex syntax when it comes to making websites interactive.

00:01:16.719 --> 00:01:18.250
In this case, I'm saying,

00:01:18.250 --> 00:01:20.204
look at the HTML document,

00:01:20.204 --> 00:01:22.109
get all the h1 elements,

00:01:22.109 --> 00:01:24.420
give me the first h1 tag,

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:26.424
and then change it to HTML.

00:01:26.424 --> 00:01:31.030
The actual on-click functionality happens because like I showed before,

00:01:31.030 --> 00:01:35.234
I put in on-click attribute in the image tag.

00:01:35.234 --> 00:01:37.730
Thankfully, there are libraries that make

00:01:37.730 --> 00:01:40.799
working with JavaScript and front end development easier.

00:01:40.799 --> 00:01:46.659
Here, I'll show you one library called jQuery that makes JavaScript much easier to use.

00:01:46.659 --> 00:01:50.719
First, you'll need to link to the jQuery library either by

00:01:50.719 --> 00:01:55.700
downloading the file or pointing to a web address containing the library.

00:01:55.700 --> 00:01:57.500
You can download the jQuery file from

00:01:57.500 --> 00:02:01.944
the jQuery website or you can use a link that contains the file.

00:02:01.944 --> 00:02:04.729
For example, Google has the jQuery library

00:02:04.730 --> 00:02:07.715
on the web that you can link to. I'm going to do that.

00:02:07.715 --> 00:02:10.580
So, I'm going to erase the JavaScript code that I've already

00:02:10.580 --> 00:02:13.860
written and I'm going to link to the jQuery library.

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:18.495
Now, I'm going to make a new script's tag and a closing tag,

00:02:18.495 --> 00:02:21.670
and then write some jQuery code here in between.

00:02:21.669 --> 00:02:25.199
This is saying, wait for the document to get ready.

00:02:25.199 --> 00:02:28.009
In other words, waiting for the document to load,

00:02:28.009 --> 00:02:31.250
then grab the image tag,

00:02:31.250 --> 00:02:33.574
put on on-click function,

00:02:33.574 --> 00:02:38.414
and finally, change the h1 tag text.

00:02:38.414 --> 00:02:43.924
Then, I just need to close all of my brackets in parentheses and you can see it works.

00:02:43.925 --> 00:02:45.460
When I click on the image,

00:02:45.460 --> 00:02:47.265
the h1 tag changes.

00:02:47.264 --> 00:02:49.454
Also, just like CSS,

00:02:49.455 --> 00:02:55.760
I can either include the code in the HTML file using a script's tag or alternatively,

00:02:55.759 --> 00:03:00.424
I can put the JavaScript into a separate file and link to that file.

00:03:00.425 --> 00:03:04.855
I'm going to do that now. So, I'm going to just create a new file,

00:03:04.854 --> 00:03:09.935
let's call it interaction.js where JS is for JavaScript.

00:03:09.935 --> 00:03:17.240
Now, I'm going to cut this JavaScript code and put it into my interaction.js file.

00:03:17.240 --> 00:03:19.890
Then, here, in the script's tag,

00:03:19.889 --> 00:03:21.529
I need to specify the source,

00:03:21.530 --> 00:03:25.800
which in this case is just this interaction.js file,

00:03:25.800 --> 00:03:28.380
which is in the same folder as the HTML document,

00:03:28.379 --> 00:03:31.159
and notice that the jQuery code still works.

00:03:31.159 --> 00:03:34.984
So, that's essentially JavaScript and what you can do with JavaScript.

00:03:34.984 --> 00:03:37.915
Before you move on to the JavaScript exercises,

00:03:37.914 --> 00:03:42.359
I just want to give you two more examples of some jQuery code.

00:03:42.360 --> 00:03:49.550
So currently, this document has the same code as before where if you click on the image,

00:03:49.550 --> 00:03:53.010
the text in the h1 tag will change.

00:03:53.009 --> 00:03:55.185
Okay. So, what else can we add?

00:03:55.185 --> 00:03:58.134
jQuery gives you a lot of options.

00:03:58.134 --> 00:04:00.319
So, I'm going to add two things.

00:04:00.319 --> 00:04:05.629
One, I'm going to add a fade in when the page loads and just as another example,

00:04:05.629 --> 00:04:11.615
I'm going to have the image fade out when I click on the h1 tag at the top.

00:04:11.615 --> 00:04:13.520
So, let me code that for you.

00:04:13.520 --> 00:04:18.905
So, like before, you have to get the document and wait for it to be ready.

00:04:18.904 --> 00:04:22.129
Now, I want to add something to the body tag.

00:04:22.129 --> 00:04:24.300
So, I have to select the body tag.

00:04:24.300 --> 00:04:26.064
Now, I'm going to say,

00:04:26.064 --> 00:04:27.569
hide the body tag.

00:04:27.569 --> 00:04:34.355
So, it's going to hide all of the content on load and then I want to fade in slowly.

00:04:34.355 --> 00:04:37.009
Notice as well, here, I've used double quotes.

00:04:37.009 --> 00:04:38.134
Here, I've used single quotes.

00:04:38.134 --> 00:04:39.324
It actually doesn't matter,

00:04:39.324 --> 00:04:43.789
but I should be consistent about it and either do double quotes or single quotes.

00:04:43.790 --> 00:04:47.500
Now, I'm just going to close all of our brackets in parentheses.

00:04:47.500 --> 00:04:49.569
You notice now when the page loads,

00:04:49.569 --> 00:04:51.610
it has a slow fade in.

00:04:51.610 --> 00:04:55.550
Okay. Now, let's add the extra click functionality where

00:04:55.550 --> 00:04:59.540
clicking on the h1 title at the top will fade out the image at the bottom.

00:04:59.540 --> 00:05:03.305
So again, you wait for the document to load and be ready.

00:05:03.305 --> 00:05:09.189
Now, we want to add a click function to the h1 tag,

00:05:09.189 --> 00:05:12.024
and then we want to take the image,

00:05:12.024 --> 00:05:15.129
and fade it out slowly,

00:05:15.129 --> 00:05:17.420
and then we close all our brackets again,

00:05:17.420 --> 00:05:19.694
and see if it worked.

00:05:19.694 --> 00:05:25.639
There it goes. So, the jQuery documentation is pretty extensive and again,

00:05:25.639 --> 00:05:29.610
the libraries we're going to use are actually going to take care of the jQuery for you,

00:05:29.610 --> 00:05:33.865
but I at least wanted you to understand what was going on underneath the hood.

00:05:33.865 --> 00:05:36.500
So, use the information in this video to help you

00:05:36.500 --> 00:05:39.800
out with the jQuery exercise coming up next.

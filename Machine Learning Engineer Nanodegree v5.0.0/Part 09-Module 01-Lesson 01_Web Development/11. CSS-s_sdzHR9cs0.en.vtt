00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.410
I'm at the Google News website.

00:00:02.410 --> 00:00:05.400
The Google News website has a nice layout, doesn't it?

00:00:05.400 --> 00:00:08.030
For example if I shrink the browser,

00:00:08.029 --> 00:00:11.389
everything adapts to a smaller screen.

00:00:11.390 --> 00:00:15.810
All the content is divided into clear sections,

00:00:15.810 --> 00:00:17.879
this is all done with CSS styling.

00:00:17.879 --> 00:00:21.299
So, I'm going to show you a little trick where you can

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:24.719
actually remove the CSS for a website.

00:00:24.719 --> 00:00:27.629
I'm going to open something called developer tools

00:00:27.629 --> 00:00:31.199
which lets you see the code that makes up a website.

00:00:31.199 --> 00:00:34.500
I'm in Chrome and if you go to the menu bar at the top.

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:39.475
It's under view, then developer and finally developer tools.

00:00:39.475 --> 00:00:45.620
So, here in this box is the HTML for this website,

00:00:45.619 --> 00:00:48.049
I'm going to delete the head tag which among

00:00:48.049 --> 00:00:51.394
other things contains code for the CSS styling.

00:00:51.395 --> 00:00:56.510
Now all we're left with is the HTML of the website,

00:00:56.509 --> 00:01:00.949
if I scroll down you can see that this looks a lot like the HTML code

00:01:00.950 --> 00:01:05.480
that you've been writing it's just HTML without any style attached to it.

00:01:05.480 --> 00:01:08.915
I wanted to show you this because behind every webpage,

00:01:08.915 --> 00:01:11.280
no matter how good the page looks,

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:16.210
it's really just HTML holding all of the content.

00:01:16.209 --> 00:01:19.709
The styling like the column layout, colors,

00:01:19.709 --> 00:01:23.659
fonts, all of these are specified using a language called CSS.

00:01:23.659 --> 00:01:26.569
CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets.

00:01:26.569 --> 00:01:31.699
You write CSS code to specify what each element on your page should look like.

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:34.504
I'm going to give you a quick intro to CSS.

00:01:34.504 --> 00:01:38.420
Although to build the actual web app at the end of this lesson,

00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:42.570
you'll use a front end library that does the CSS styling for you.

00:01:42.569 --> 00:01:45.289
Here's the webpage that we've been working on.

00:01:45.290 --> 00:01:48.590
There are essentially two different ways to write CSS,

00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:52.645
inline CSS and CSS written in a style sheet.

00:01:52.644 --> 00:01:58.759
With inline CSS you specify the style inside a tag using the style attribute.

00:01:58.760 --> 00:02:02.900
For example, to change the first paragraph to a bold font,

00:02:02.900 --> 00:02:08.599
I would write style equals font weight bold.

00:02:08.599 --> 00:02:11.090
So, you can see the syntax here,

00:02:11.090 --> 00:02:14.259
I say what I want to change in this case the font weight,

00:02:14.259 --> 00:02:15.979
how I want to change it,

00:02:15.979 --> 00:02:20.659
I want it to be bold, and then I need to separate those two with a colon,

00:02:20.659 --> 00:02:23.539
and then finally I end with a semicolon.

00:02:23.539 --> 00:02:26.530
I can add other things here like let's say color red.

00:02:26.530 --> 00:02:30.729
So, I'm adding another rule to this paragraph and everything turns red.

00:02:30.729 --> 00:02:33.799
You can do all kinds of things to change the styling,

00:02:33.800 --> 00:02:36.230
and I'll put some references below the video so that

00:02:36.229 --> 00:02:38.929
you can see all the different things you can do.

00:02:38.930 --> 00:02:41.340
I'm going to start adding some more style rules,

00:02:41.340 --> 00:02:45.825
for example here in the body, I'm going to say,

00:02:45.824 --> 00:02:52.164
margin-left 20 pixels, margin right 20 pixels,

00:02:52.164 --> 00:02:53.459
and let's see what that does.

00:02:53.460 --> 00:02:55.180
So, if you've noticed,

00:02:55.180 --> 00:02:58.730
it actually squeeze in my content a

00:02:58.729 --> 00:03:02.389
little bit so wasn't flush against the left and right side.

00:03:02.389 --> 00:03:05.674
Let's go down to the image tag here

00:03:05.675 --> 00:03:09.740
and we're going to make the image a little bit smaller.

00:03:09.740 --> 00:03:14.735
I'm going to go up to the link here,

00:03:14.735 --> 00:03:20.990
and I'm going to say style text decoration none,

00:03:20.990 --> 00:03:26.090
and you can see that it took away this underlying those underneath the link here.

00:03:26.090 --> 00:03:28.860
So, you can add all kinds of different styles.

00:03:28.860 --> 00:03:33.350
For example, what else did I have here.

00:03:33.349 --> 00:03:35.560
This green text here I could style here,

00:03:35.560 --> 00:03:38.689
and say color green.

00:03:38.689 --> 00:03:41.750
So, you can do all sorts of things.

00:03:41.750 --> 00:03:45.485
The problem however with writing CSS this way

00:03:45.485 --> 00:03:50.285
is that you have to specify the CSS for each individual tag,

00:03:50.284 --> 00:03:52.280
and that's kind of tedious.

00:03:52.280 --> 00:03:55.490
It also doesn't totally take advantage of what CSS can

00:03:55.490 --> 00:03:59.900
do which is essentially to separate the content in HTML,

00:03:59.900 --> 00:04:02.150
and make the styling totally separate.

00:04:02.150 --> 00:04:06.060
I'm going to start over again from scratch with the original HTML,

00:04:06.060 --> 00:04:07.849
that didn't have any styling.

00:04:07.849 --> 00:04:13.044
So, an alternative way to putting the style is here with the style sheet.

00:04:13.044 --> 00:04:15.334
So, I go up into the head tag,

00:04:15.335 --> 00:04:20.629
and I make this new element called style.

00:04:20.629 --> 00:04:24.259
Now I can add CSS rules into the style sheet so that it's

00:04:24.259 --> 00:04:28.060
actually separated from the HTML content.

00:04:28.060 --> 00:04:30.980
The syntax in a style sheet is to first

00:04:30.980 --> 00:04:36.170
specify the element type tag or class that you want to style,

00:04:36.170 --> 00:04:38.430
and then you write out a rule for the style.

00:04:38.430 --> 00:04:44.600
For example, if I want to style only the paragraph with the p top ID,

00:04:44.600 --> 00:04:49.750
I specify the p top ID using the pound sign, right up p top,

00:04:49.750 --> 00:04:54.529
open squiggly bracket, close squiggly bracket,

00:04:54.529 --> 00:04:57.259
and then I write my style rule inside.

00:04:57.259 --> 00:05:00.969
In this case I'm going say font, weight bold,

00:05:00.970 --> 00:05:06.485
and you can see now that the first top paragraph has a font-weight bold.

00:05:06.485 --> 00:05:09.780
Let's add some more rules just so you can see what it looks like.

00:05:09.779 --> 00:05:13.809
OK. What if I want to style the body tag?

00:05:13.810 --> 00:05:18.079
All I have to do here is write body to represent the body tag,

00:05:18.079 --> 00:05:21.079
and then have my open and close squiggly brackets,

00:05:21.079 --> 00:05:25.789
and then I can specify whatever I want like margin left 20 pixels,

00:05:25.790 --> 00:05:30.560
margin right 20 pixels and again that's squeezing all

00:05:30.560 --> 00:05:35.350
of the texts all of the content so that it's not flush with the sides anymore.

00:05:35.350 --> 00:05:37.560
I can add a border,

00:05:37.560 --> 00:05:42.095
maybe add some padding so that everything isn't stuck right on the border.

00:05:42.095 --> 00:05:45.410
So, you can see I'm starting to style all this.

00:05:45.410 --> 00:05:48.615
I want to style the image so that it's not so large,

00:05:48.615 --> 00:05:52.509
takeaway those underlines from the links,

00:05:52.509 --> 00:05:54.500
and then if you go down to the HTML,

00:05:54.500 --> 00:05:57.160
remember I have this class called green text.

00:05:57.160 --> 00:06:00.410
So, to add style to a class,

00:06:00.410 --> 00:06:02.990
I use this.syntax, and then the name of

00:06:02.990 --> 00:06:07.639
the class and I'm going to change the color to green.

00:06:07.639 --> 00:06:12.689
So, you can start to see the advantages of using IDs and classes.

00:06:12.689 --> 00:06:15.469
For example with the ID on

00:06:15.470 --> 00:06:19.880
the first paragraph I was able to just make this first paragraph bold,

00:06:19.879 --> 00:06:24.870
and with the green text class I could make just this part green,

00:06:24.870 --> 00:06:26.365
and this part green,

00:06:26.365 --> 00:06:28.805
by just using one style rule.

00:06:28.805 --> 00:06:32.300
Writing the style this way is called an internal style

00:06:32.300 --> 00:06:36.480
sheet because it's still internal to the HTML document.

00:06:36.480 --> 00:06:39.890
To make the code even cleaner and modular,

00:06:39.889 --> 00:06:43.389
you can put the CSS into a separate file.

00:06:43.389 --> 00:06:50.649
Now, the last step is to link to the style sheet in the HTML document.

00:06:50.649 --> 00:06:54.169
You do that with the link tag and here in

00:06:54.170 --> 00:06:58.615
the h-ref attribute you put the name of the file,

00:06:58.615 --> 00:07:02.269
close everything and now you've got your CSS styling.

00:07:02.269 --> 00:07:04.310
So, now the content in

00:07:04.310 --> 00:07:09.754
the HTML document and the styling in the CSS document are completely separate.

00:07:09.754 --> 00:07:14.870
I want to mention that I know I am showing you a lot of things at a very rapid pace,

00:07:14.870 --> 00:07:19.514
but the goal is to become proficient not necessarily an expert.

00:07:19.514 --> 00:07:23.870
Soon, I'll present a few tools that make web development somewhat easier,

00:07:23.870 --> 00:07:27.399
so that you don't have to know all of these CSS rules.

00:07:27.399 --> 00:07:29.359
But I'm giving you an introduction so that

00:07:29.360 --> 00:07:31.910
you understand what's happening behind the scenes.

00:07:31.910 --> 00:07:36.720
Next up you'll practice writing CSS and then we'll move on to JavaScript.

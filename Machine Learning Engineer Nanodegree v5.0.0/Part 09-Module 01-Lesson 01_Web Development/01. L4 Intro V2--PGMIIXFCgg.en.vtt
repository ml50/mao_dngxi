00:00:05.540 --> 00:00:09.074
So far, in the software engineering section,

00:00:09.074 --> 00:00:12.139
you practiced writing clean and maintainable code.

00:00:12.140 --> 00:00:14.455
Then, in object oriented programming,

00:00:14.455 --> 00:00:16.399
you built a Python package.

00:00:16.399 --> 00:00:18.939
In this final software engineering lesson,

00:00:18.940 --> 00:00:24.159
you're going to use your new skills to build an actual application, a data dashboard.

00:00:24.158 --> 00:00:26.469
A data dashboard is a collection of

00:00:26.469 --> 00:00:30.054
visualizations that help you track key metrics and trends.

00:00:30.054 --> 00:00:35.640
Creating dashboards is a common task for both data analysts and data scientists.

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:39.240
Making a Web dashboard from scratch however,

00:00:39.240 --> 00:00:43.070
requires a wide set of tools including HTML,

00:00:43.070 --> 00:00:47.405
JavaScript, CSS, Linux, some object oriented programming,

00:00:47.405 --> 00:00:51.520
and for this particular dashboard that you're going to make, Python.

00:00:51.520 --> 00:00:55.160
At Udacity, we have an entire nanodegree

00:00:55.159 --> 00:00:59.179
dedicated to learning these skills called Full-Stack Web Developer.

00:00:59.179 --> 00:01:04.109
Because making a Web app is its own career path that takes months to learn,

00:01:04.109 --> 00:01:08.935
this lesson will give a relatively quick and high level overview of Web development.

00:01:08.935 --> 00:01:11.510
We'll also provide you with a template to make

00:01:11.510 --> 00:01:14.045
building and deploying the application easier.

00:01:14.045 --> 00:01:16.820
You'll even be able to reuse this template to build

00:01:16.819 --> 00:01:19.759
your own data dashboards outside of this course.

00:01:19.760 --> 00:01:21.350
By the end of the lesson,

00:01:21.349 --> 00:01:26.309
you'll have deployed a public facing Web app accessible via the Internet.

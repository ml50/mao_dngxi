00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.384
What if you wanted to make the first paragraph bold,

00:00:03.384 --> 00:00:04.859
with a larger font,

00:00:04.860 --> 00:00:08.445
and then the last two paragraphs with an italic font.

00:00:08.445 --> 00:00:12.945
To change the font and font style, you'll need CSS.

00:00:12.945 --> 00:00:17.695
But we're not quite ready yet to add CSS styling.

00:00:17.695 --> 00:00:22.199
You'll need to differentiate between the first paragraph and the other paragraphs.

00:00:22.199 --> 00:00:27.579
HTML has attributes specifically for differentiating elements from each other,

00:00:27.579 --> 00:00:30.889
the ID attribute and the class attribute.

00:00:30.890 --> 00:00:35.460
IDs uniquely identify a piece of content.

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:42.664
For example, I can use an ID in the first paragraph to add ID equals P top.

00:00:42.664 --> 00:00:44.729
As you'll see later in this lesson,

00:00:44.729 --> 00:00:49.984
you can now pick out the P top paragraph and add a bold font just to that paragraph.

00:00:49.984 --> 00:00:56.149
An ID is a unique identifier that you should only use once per HTML page.

00:00:56.149 --> 00:00:58.504
You can name IDs whatever you want,

00:00:58.505 --> 00:01:00.830
but you should only use the name once,

00:01:00.829 --> 00:01:04.390
and the tag should only have one ID.

00:01:04.390 --> 00:01:08.689
So, the paragraph tag can only have that P Top ID.

00:01:08.689 --> 00:01:11.929
I'll add a few other IDs to reinforce this.

00:01:11.930 --> 00:01:16.480
So, for example, the middle paragraph can be P middle,

00:01:16.480 --> 00:01:18.710
and the bottom P bottom.

00:01:18.709 --> 00:01:22.164
I'm going to add IDs to the div tags as well.

00:01:22.165 --> 00:01:27.405
Like ID equals link section and ID equals paragraph section.

00:01:27.405 --> 00:01:30.680
Like I said, IDs can go in any tag.

00:01:30.680 --> 00:01:33.740
Each element can have one ID,

00:01:33.739 --> 00:01:36.155
and each ID name should be unique.

00:01:36.155 --> 00:01:41.995
The idea is that you're separating out the content for different CSS styling.

00:01:41.995 --> 00:01:44.189
Classes on the other hand,

00:01:44.189 --> 00:01:47.209
group multiple pieces of content together.

00:01:47.209 --> 00:01:53.129
So, for example I could add a class to these two bottom paragraphs called italic text.

00:01:53.129 --> 00:01:58.349
Implying that I'm going to style these two paragraphs with an italic font.

00:01:58.349 --> 00:02:00.799
You can name a class whatever you want,

00:02:00.799 --> 00:02:03.319
and you can use a class name multiple times in

00:02:03.319 --> 00:02:07.864
an HTML document in order to group pieces of content together.

00:02:07.864 --> 00:02:11.335
An element can even have more than one class.

00:02:11.335 --> 00:02:14.490
Like I could add another class called green text.

00:02:14.490 --> 00:02:18.390
Implying I'm going to style this last paragraph green.

00:02:18.389 --> 00:02:21.500
I could have the same green text class to a link.

00:02:21.500 --> 00:02:26.620
Adding IDs and classes will give you more control over your website's CSS styling,

00:02:26.620 --> 00:02:32.045
they help you add style to your pages in a logical organized way.

00:02:32.044 --> 00:02:33.769
In the next exercise,

00:02:33.770 --> 00:02:36.594
you'll get practice adding div and span tags,

00:02:36.594 --> 00:02:39.199
as well as using classes and IDs.

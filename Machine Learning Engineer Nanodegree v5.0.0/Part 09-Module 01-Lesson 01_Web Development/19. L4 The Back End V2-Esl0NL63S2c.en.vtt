00:00:06.410 --> 00:00:09.240
That's it for the front-end.

00:00:09.240 --> 00:00:14.519
You should now have a webpage with a few links and a couple of data visualizations.

00:00:14.519 --> 00:00:17.100
This is already something you could put in

00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:21.145
your portfolio because it shows off your data visualization skills.

00:00:21.144 --> 00:00:25.375
If you haven't started a portfolio yet with your other Nanodegree projects,

00:00:25.375 --> 00:00:28.129
now's the perfect time.

00:00:28.129 --> 00:00:31.799
All of your files are currently in a directory in

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:34.954
the classroom workspace or on your local computer.

00:00:34.954 --> 00:00:40.474
You should be able to open the HTML file in a local web browser and see the dashboard.

00:00:40.475 --> 00:00:43.789
Currently, if you wanted to share your dashboard with

00:00:43.789 --> 00:00:48.719
a coworker you'd have to transfer all of these files to your coworkers computer.

00:00:48.719 --> 00:00:52.719
Then hat person would have to open the HTML document locally,

00:00:52.719 --> 00:00:57.304
which is a whole lot of fuss just to show off your visualizations.

00:00:57.304 --> 00:01:01.340
It would be much nicer if your web app were on the Internet.

00:01:01.340 --> 00:01:06.340
Then, anyone could type a web address in a browser and see your work.

00:01:06.340 --> 00:01:09.670
But how do you get your dashboard onto the internet?

00:01:09.670 --> 00:01:12.284
For that, you'll need a back-end.

00:01:12.284 --> 00:01:16.969
You're going to build a simple back-end using a framework called Flask.

00:01:16.969 --> 00:01:18.709
For a data scientist,

00:01:18.709 --> 00:01:24.594
one of the biggest benefits of Flask is that the framework is written in Python.

00:01:24.594 --> 00:01:27.754
That means, you can use scikit-learn,

00:01:27.754 --> 00:01:31.550
pandas and numPy in your back-end code if you

00:01:31.549 --> 00:01:36.009
need to do any data wrangling or run machine learning algorithms.

00:01:36.010 --> 00:01:38.490
Once you've coded the back-end,

00:01:38.489 --> 00:01:41.744
you'll be ready to deploy your application to a server.

00:01:41.745 --> 00:01:47.300
Deployment will be the last step to getting your application on the internet.

00:01:47.299 --> 00:01:52.879
Let's get started with building the back-end and deploying the web app to a server.

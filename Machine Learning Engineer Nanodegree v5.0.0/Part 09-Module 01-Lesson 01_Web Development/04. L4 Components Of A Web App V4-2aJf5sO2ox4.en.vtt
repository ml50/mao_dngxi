00:00:06.080 --> 00:00:10.539
Before going into the details of how to build the application,

00:00:10.539 --> 00:00:13.574
let's talk about the different components of a web app.

00:00:13.574 --> 00:00:17.799
A web app essentially has two parts; the front end,

00:00:17.800 --> 00:00:20.350
which is what we see when navigating a website,

00:00:20.350 --> 00:00:21.655
and the back end,

00:00:21.655 --> 00:00:26.190
which are all the processes and data working behind the scenes.

00:00:26.190 --> 00:00:28.464
When you open a web page,

00:00:28.464 --> 00:00:30.379
you're looking at the front end.

00:00:30.379 --> 00:00:33.280
You can think of the page as having three parts.

00:00:33.280 --> 00:00:34.850
The first part is content,

00:00:34.850 --> 00:00:38.789
which includes text, images, videos, and forms.

00:00:38.789 --> 00:00:42.740
You control this content with a language called HTML.

00:00:42.740 --> 00:00:46.400
The second part is the design, like the colors,

00:00:46.399 --> 00:00:48.564
font styles, and layout,

00:00:48.564 --> 00:00:52.984
all of which you manage using another language called CSS.

00:00:52.984 --> 00:00:56.689
The third part includes all of the animations and

00:00:56.689 --> 00:01:00.945
interactivity such as fade-ins, slideshows, and pop-ups.

00:01:00.945 --> 00:01:06.155
The code to make this happen is written in a language called JavaScript.

00:01:06.155 --> 00:01:09.844
The back end is responsible for running the web app.

00:01:09.844 --> 00:01:14.045
But you don't actually see the back end when looking at a web page.

00:01:14.045 --> 00:01:18.665
The back end includes the server where the website files are stored.

00:01:18.665 --> 00:01:21.640
When you type in a web address and hit "Enter",

00:01:21.640 --> 00:01:25.409
you're actually asking the server to send you the HTML,

00:01:25.409 --> 00:01:30.394
CSS and JavaScript files that make up the front end of your web app.

00:01:30.394 --> 00:01:35.134
A web app might also have a database as part of the back end.

00:01:35.135 --> 00:01:37.820
The code that controls the server and

00:01:37.819 --> 00:01:41.729
communicates with the database is all part of the back end.

00:01:41.730 --> 00:01:49.130
You can code the back end in a variety of languages including PHP, Java, and Ruby.

00:01:49.129 --> 00:01:52.039
Because you're already familiar with Python,

00:01:52.040 --> 00:01:54.640
we are going to use Python for this lesson.

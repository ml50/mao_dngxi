00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.929
Before you start coding,

00:00:01.929 --> 00:00:05.235
I wanted to show you what you're going to build in this lesson.

00:00:05.235 --> 00:00:11.475
This is a web app that uses data from the World Bank and outputs a few visualizations.

00:00:11.474 --> 00:00:14.024
Let me show you what it looks like.

00:00:14.025 --> 00:00:18.089
I've used a few libraries to help me put this together,

00:00:18.089 --> 00:00:23.445
including Bootstrap to organize the front-end and Plotly for the visualizations.

00:00:23.445 --> 00:00:27.140
In the lesson, you'll build this up one piece at a time,

00:00:27.140 --> 00:00:30.920
and then afterwards, you can customize this to make it your own.

00:00:30.920 --> 00:00:35.329
Let's start with the first piece of building this HTML.

00:00:35.329 --> 00:00:39.469
Here on the left is a document with HTML code,

00:00:39.469 --> 00:00:43.310
and on the right this is what the HTML looks like when opening

00:00:43.310 --> 00:00:47.600
the file in a browser like Chrome, Firefox, or Safari.

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:50.929
I'm actually using a work space in the classroom where I

00:00:50.929 --> 00:00:54.439
can write HTML and then instantly see what it looks like.

00:00:54.439 --> 00:00:58.589
You'll be using this same work space to practice writing code.

00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:00.290
At the end of this video,

00:01:00.289 --> 00:01:03.804
I'll show you how to open this file locally on your computer as well.

00:01:03.804 --> 00:01:09.364
HTML is organized into elements that divide up the document into sections.

00:01:09.364 --> 00:01:12.049
Think of an element as a generic idea,

00:01:12.049 --> 00:01:13.158
such as a paragraph,

00:01:13.159 --> 00:01:14.600
with all of its text.

00:01:14.599 --> 00:01:17.239
All of these brackets are called tags.

00:01:17.239 --> 00:01:19.364
So, if I say the head element,

00:01:19.364 --> 00:01:21.204
I'm referring to lines four,

00:01:21.204 --> 00:01:26.325
five and six of the code containing all of the information about the head.

00:01:26.325 --> 00:01:27.939
If I say the head tag,

00:01:27.939 --> 00:01:32.995
I'm referring to the actual HTML syntax with the word surrounded by brackets.

00:01:32.995 --> 00:01:37.030
At the top, the first tag declares the document type.

00:01:37.030 --> 00:01:39.835
It says that this is an HTML document.

00:01:39.834 --> 00:01:44.599
Then comes the HTML element where all the HTML code is written.

00:01:44.599 --> 00:01:50.754
Notice how the HTML element has two parts: a tag that has a left angle bracket then

00:01:50.754 --> 00:01:53.539
HTML and then a right angle bracket

00:01:53.540 --> 00:01:57.050
and another tag that looks similar but also has a slash.

00:01:57.049 --> 00:02:00.634
These are called opening and closing tags respectively.

00:02:00.635 --> 00:02:05.695
In this case, the opening tag tells the browser that HTML code is about to start,

00:02:05.694 --> 00:02:09.894
and the closing tag tells the browser that the HTML code ends.

00:02:09.895 --> 00:02:15.844
Everything in-between the start and end HTML tag is HTML code.

00:02:15.844 --> 00:02:20.689
Both head and body have opening tags as well as closing tags.

00:02:20.689 --> 00:02:24.865
Everything inside the head tag belongs to the head element,

00:02:24.865 --> 00:02:29.055
and everything inside the body tag belongs to the body element.

00:02:29.055 --> 00:02:33.400
The head element contains a title with opening and closing tags.

00:02:33.400 --> 00:02:36.955
The title of the page usually shows up in a browser tab,

00:02:36.955 --> 00:02:39.530
and the body element contains the book of

00:02:39.530 --> 00:02:43.495
the HTML code that you actually see when looking at a webpage.

00:02:43.495 --> 00:02:47.770
You put your website content inside of body elements.

00:02:47.770 --> 00:02:52.325
There are all types of elements that can go inside the body of an HTML document,

00:02:52.324 --> 00:02:55.044
including header elements, link elements,

00:02:55.044 --> 00:02:57.619
paragraph elements, and image elements.

00:02:57.620 --> 00:03:00.974
These elements define your website content.

00:03:00.974 --> 00:03:05.069
In this case, I have a header followed by a link,

00:03:05.069 --> 00:03:07.894
then a paragraph, and finally an image.

00:03:07.895 --> 00:03:12.575
Notice how all of these elements have opening tags and closing tags,

00:03:12.574 --> 00:03:14.479
except for the image element.

00:03:14.479 --> 00:03:17.149
Image elements don't require closing tags,

00:03:17.150 --> 00:03:20.150
so image elements are an exception to the rule.

00:03:20.150 --> 00:03:23.060
I formatted the document with tabs so that it's easy to

00:03:23.060 --> 00:03:26.430
see the hierarchical structure of an HTML document,

00:03:26.430 --> 00:03:28.680
and I recommend that you do the same.

00:03:28.680 --> 00:03:32.650
However, you do not have to format your HTML at all.

00:03:32.650 --> 00:03:37.205
The nesting tags structure determines how HTML gets rendered in the browser,

00:03:37.205 --> 00:03:40.090
not the formatting of the HTML document itself.

00:03:40.090 --> 00:03:41.979
I could remove the tabs,

00:03:41.979 --> 00:03:45.939
and I'll do that now, and the document would render exactly the same way.

00:03:45.939 --> 00:03:49.250
But I'm going to put it back as the way it was.

00:03:49.250 --> 00:03:52.764
There are many more HTML elements than the ones in this example.

00:03:52.764 --> 00:03:57.154
These include elements for making lists, forms, and tables.

00:03:57.155 --> 00:04:00.979
I'll provide a link below the video where you can learn more.

00:04:00.979 --> 00:04:04.625
It's common to think of HTML as a tree structure.

00:04:04.625 --> 00:04:06.955
The first node is an HTML tag,

00:04:06.955 --> 00:04:10.560
and then the head and body tags split off from there.

00:04:10.560 --> 00:04:13.594
The head tag can contain a title tag

00:04:13.594 --> 00:04:16.740
as well as a few other tags like meta and style tags,

00:04:16.740 --> 00:04:18.530
which we haven't discussed yet.

00:04:18.529 --> 00:04:20.539
The body will contain headers,

00:04:20.540 --> 00:04:23.735
paragraphs, images, links, etc.

00:04:23.735 --> 00:04:25.345
Within some of those tags,

00:04:25.345 --> 00:04:27.050
you can actually have other tags.

00:04:27.050 --> 00:04:29.590
For example, in a paragraph tag,

00:04:29.589 --> 00:04:32.164
you can have an image as well as a link.

00:04:32.165 --> 00:04:36.480
Now, take a moment to practice writing your own HTML document.

00:04:36.480 --> 00:04:39.765
You can use a work space in the next part of the classroom.

00:04:39.764 --> 00:04:42.409
The work space automatically saves your work as you

00:04:42.410 --> 00:04:45.935
type and also refreshes the rendering of your code.

00:04:45.935 --> 00:04:49.269
I'll add an extra link so you can see what I mean.

00:04:49.269 --> 00:04:52.754
Here, I'm adding a link to the Udacity website,

00:04:52.754 --> 00:04:57.329
and you can see on the right-hand side that it renders as I type.

00:04:57.329 --> 00:05:00.919
As an alternative, you can open any text editor to write

00:05:00.920 --> 00:05:05.460
your code and then save the document with the.html extension,

00:05:05.459 --> 00:05:08.734
just like here where it says index.html.

00:05:08.735 --> 00:05:12.670
Here's an example. On my desktop, I have a folder,

00:05:12.670 --> 00:05:19.625
and inside the folder, I have the index.html and the photo.jpeg files.

00:05:19.625 --> 00:05:24.569
If I open index.html with the text editor,

00:05:24.569 --> 00:05:28.569
you can see the HTML code and I can modify it here.

00:05:28.569 --> 00:05:33.764
If I open index.html in the Chrome web browser,

00:05:33.764 --> 00:05:36.269
I can see the rendered result.

00:05:36.269 --> 00:05:39.669
Now, it's your turn to write some HTML code.

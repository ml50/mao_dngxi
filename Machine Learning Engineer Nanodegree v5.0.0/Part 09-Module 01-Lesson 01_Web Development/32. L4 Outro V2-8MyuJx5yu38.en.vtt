00:00:06.530 --> 00:00:11.289
Wow! Congrats on getting your Web application up and running.

00:00:11.289 --> 00:00:13.424
The best part about this Web app,

00:00:13.425 --> 00:00:16.234
is that you can repurpose it for future analysis,

00:00:16.234 --> 00:00:18.695
and then share your results with the world.

00:00:18.695 --> 00:00:21.079
Let's recap what you've learned.

00:00:21.079 --> 00:00:24.039
First, you practice using the front-end languages,

00:00:24.039 --> 00:00:26.924
HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

00:00:26.925 --> 00:00:29.955
Then, you saw how a framework like Bootstrap,

00:00:29.954 --> 00:00:33.934
makes front-end Web development much easier to accomplish.

00:00:33.935 --> 00:00:37.625
Next, you made visualizations using Plotly,

00:00:37.625 --> 00:00:42.005
which is one of the most popular libraries for displaying charts on the Web,

00:00:42.005 --> 00:00:45.565
and finally, you created a back-end using Flask,

00:00:45.564 --> 00:00:48.234
and then deployed your Web app to the Internet.

00:00:48.234 --> 00:00:50.079
Great work.

00:00:50.079 --> 00:00:54.254
Make sure to include the Web app as part of your professional portfolio,

00:00:54.255 --> 00:00:57.695
and share it with your friends, family, and colleagues.

00:00:57.695 --> 00:01:01.640
It's a nice way to show off your software engineering skills.

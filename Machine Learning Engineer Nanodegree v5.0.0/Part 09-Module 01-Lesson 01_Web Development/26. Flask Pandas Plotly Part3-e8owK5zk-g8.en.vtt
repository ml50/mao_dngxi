00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.629
Okay. So, in this web app so far,

00:00:03.629 --> 00:00:06.835
we only had data for the United States and it was one line.

00:00:06.835 --> 00:00:12.724
So now, I've done a graph where I have all of these data from different countries.

00:00:12.724 --> 00:00:16.335
So, let me show you how I did this and it's not that much code.

00:00:16.335 --> 00:00:18.795
Going back here to the workspace,

00:00:18.795 --> 00:00:22.385
all I did was change a little bit of the routes.py file.

00:00:22.385 --> 00:00:26.495
So, here what I have commented was the code before where I had

00:00:26.495 --> 00:00:31.100
graph one and I was just using data from the United States in the x,

00:00:31.100 --> 00:00:36.195
y and name parts of this list.

00:00:36.195 --> 00:00:39.770
If I go down here, what I've done now,

00:00:39.770 --> 00:00:44.255
is I've made this graph one list and then I'm actually

00:00:44.255 --> 00:00:49.210
iterating through the data and for each country I have of data,

00:00:49.210 --> 00:00:55.185
I am appending part of the visualization to this graph one list.

00:00:55.185 --> 00:00:58.130
So, you might have to stare at this code for a little bit to understand

00:00:58.130 --> 00:01:01.325
what I did but essentially it's really similar.

00:01:01.325 --> 00:01:04.630
You still have this go.scatter part here,

00:01:04.629 --> 00:01:08.155
but the difference is that I keep appending

00:01:08.155 --> 00:01:13.340
new ones to this graph one list for each country in the data set.

00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:18.320
That's all I did to get this visualization to show up like this.

00:01:18.319 --> 00:01:22.234
Next, I'm going to add in a few more visualizations

00:01:22.234 --> 00:01:26.599
and also start using Bootstrap so that the front end looks a little bit better.

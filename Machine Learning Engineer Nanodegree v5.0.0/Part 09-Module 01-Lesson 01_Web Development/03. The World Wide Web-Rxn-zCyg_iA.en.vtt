In the major web browsers like Firefox or Chrome,

00:00:03.960 --> 00:00:06.570
you can actually see the messages and files

00:00:06.570 --> 00:00:09.290
getting transmitted between you and the server.

00:00:09.289 --> 00:00:11.649
In Chrome, go to the View menu,

00:00:11.650 --> 00:00:15.294
then select Developer, and Developer tools.

00:00:15.294 --> 00:00:17.024
That's what I have open here.

00:00:17.024 --> 00:00:22.250
Then click up here on the Network tab and visit a website.

00:00:22.250 --> 00:00:26.259
I'm going to visit the Udacity homepage.

00:00:26.260 --> 00:00:31.585
So, these are all the files that your browser requests when going to a web page.

00:00:31.585 --> 00:00:34.454
If you click on a file, for example, here,

00:00:34.454 --> 00:00:37.295
you'll see Request Method: GET,

00:00:37.295 --> 00:00:39.130
which is your browser saying,

00:00:39.130 --> 00:00:42.290
"Get me this file or information from the server."

00:00:42.289 --> 00:00:45.019
The reason I'm showing you all of this is so that you can

00:00:45.020 --> 00:00:49.060
physically see how the web actually works and what is going on.

00:00:49.060 --> 00:00:51.410
As you practice coding with Flask,

00:00:51.409 --> 00:00:54.109
it can be helpful to understand the basics of how

00:00:54.109 --> 00:00:57.670
the Internet works between a browser and a server.

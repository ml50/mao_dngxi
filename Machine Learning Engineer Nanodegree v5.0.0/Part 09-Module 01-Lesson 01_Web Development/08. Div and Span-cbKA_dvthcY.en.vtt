00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.525
Let's talk about how to structure and organize HTML code.

00:00:04.525 --> 00:00:06.725
As you've already experienced yourself,

00:00:06.724 --> 00:00:10.934
each new HTML tag gets rendered one after the other.

00:00:10.935 --> 00:00:14.214
So, for example, if I use a paragraph tag,

00:00:14.214 --> 00:00:16.024
and then another paragraph tag,

00:00:16.024 --> 00:00:18.644
they get rendered from top to bottom.

00:00:18.644 --> 00:00:23.829
I'm going to add a couple more links and some paragraphs to this document.

00:00:23.829 --> 00:00:29.259
So, you can see, the links get rendered one after another,

00:00:29.260 --> 00:00:34.450
and the paragraphs get rendered one after another in the order I've written the code.

00:00:34.450 --> 00:00:37.685
There's a tag called div, short for division,

00:00:37.685 --> 00:00:42.625
that is specifically used for grouping large chunks of related content.

00:00:42.625 --> 00:00:46.295
This tag lets you pick out specific parts of your document

00:00:46.295 --> 00:00:50.374
for adding CSS styles or interactions using JavaScript.

00:00:50.374 --> 00:00:54.650
I'm going to add div tags to create a separate link section,

00:00:54.649 --> 00:00:57.935
and another section around the entire bottom paragraphs.

00:00:57.935 --> 00:01:00.340
Let me expand this so you can see it better.

00:01:00.340 --> 00:01:05.034
All the div tags are doing are separating the content into separate groups.

00:01:05.034 --> 00:01:09.939
There's another tag called span that some people confuse with a div tag.

00:01:09.939 --> 00:01:12.319
A span element separates off

00:01:12.319 --> 00:01:16.279
a small piece of content such as in the middle of a paragraph.

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:18.859
For example, if you wanted to change the color of

00:01:18.859 --> 00:01:21.799
one word instead of an entire paragraph,

00:01:21.799 --> 00:01:23.494
you could use a span tag.

00:01:23.495 --> 00:01:26.375
I'm going to add one here so you can see what it looks like.

00:01:26.375 --> 00:01:31.099
Notice that the div and the span tag aren't actually changing anything,

00:01:31.099 --> 00:01:34.614
they're just ways to separate out HTML code.

00:01:34.614 --> 00:01:37.219
When you start styling your web page,

00:01:37.219 --> 00:01:40.530
the div and span tags will make more sense.

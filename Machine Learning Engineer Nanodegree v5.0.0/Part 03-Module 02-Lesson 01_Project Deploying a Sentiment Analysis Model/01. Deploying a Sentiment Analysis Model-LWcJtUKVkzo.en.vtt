00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.279
The project that you will be working on,

00:00:02.279 --> 00:00:08.894
is very similar to the XGBoost sentiment analysis web app that you created earlier on.

00:00:08.894 --> 00:00:10.080
The difference here is that,

00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:12.734
instead of using XGBoost as your algorithm,

00:00:12.734 --> 00:00:16.274
you'll be constructing your own neural network, using pytorch.

00:00:16.274 --> 00:00:18.689
Now, the pytorch functionality in SageMaker is a

00:00:18.690 --> 00:00:21.225
little bit different than the XGBoost algorithm.

00:00:21.225 --> 00:00:22.710
One of the ways in which it's different,

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:25.440
is that you get to provide your own code.

00:00:25.440 --> 00:00:29.700
As a result, you won't be able to do all of the project inside of the notebook,

00:00:29.699 --> 00:00:34.634
and instead you're going to have to make some modifications to some Python scripts.

00:00:34.634 --> 00:00:36.399
Inside of the project directory,

00:00:36.399 --> 00:00:39.564
you'll see all of the things you need to complete this project.

00:00:39.564 --> 00:00:42.364
The notebook will lead you through each of these steps,

00:00:42.365 --> 00:00:44.600
which includes all of the code that you need to

00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:48.125
complete and some additional questions that you need to answer.

00:00:48.125 --> 00:00:52.159
The train folder contains the code that will be used for training the model,

00:00:52.159 --> 00:00:54.199
and in particular you're going to have to make

00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:57.410
some modifications to the trained Python script.

00:00:57.409 --> 00:01:02.694
The serve folder contains the Python files that will be used in your deployed model.

00:01:02.695 --> 00:01:05.209
You will also need to make some changes inside of

00:01:05.209 --> 00:01:09.039
the serve folder in the predict Python file.

00:01:09.040 --> 00:01:14.480
Lastly, the website that you'll be creating that interacts with your deployed endpoint,

00:01:14.480 --> 00:01:16.520
is inside of the website folder.

00:01:16.519 --> 00:01:21.979
Now, this website is essentially the same as the one that we used in the XGBoost web app,

00:01:21.980 --> 00:01:24.424
but you'll have to set it up to work with your own endpoint.

00:01:24.424 --> 00:01:27.289
Once you've completed all the steps in the notebook,

00:01:27.290 --> 00:01:31.290
made sure to package up the notebook and the files that you modify,

00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:34.040
in particular the train file,

00:01:34.040 --> 00:01:39.460
the predict file, and the modified index file.

You should now have 3 projects total, with one being a capstone that you covers a business use case, data analysis, and predictive modeling! \n\nI'd encourage you to consider a few next steps, including:\n* Write a blog post about your course experience or projects; blog posts are a great way to share what you've learned and showcase your work!\n* Apply to at least two jobs with \"machine learning\" in the description. You have all the skills you need to apply machine learning to a job as a data analyst or engineer and the next step is just putting yourself out there! This is a good time to use the Career resources and Portal, at your disposal.\n* Most importantly, celebrate! Take a break from actively learning and celebrate your accomplishments. You've put in a lot of hard work and that is something to be very proud of :) \n\nGreat job!",

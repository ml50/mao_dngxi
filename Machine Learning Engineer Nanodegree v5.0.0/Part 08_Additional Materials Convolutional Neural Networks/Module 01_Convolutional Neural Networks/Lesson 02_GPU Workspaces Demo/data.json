These workspaces provide a Jupyter notebook server directly in your browser. This lesson will briefly introduce the Workspaces interface.\n\n### Important Notes:\n\n- Workspaces sessions are connections from your browser to a remote server. Each student has a limited number of GPU hours allocated on the servers (the allocation is significantly more than completing the projects is expected to take). There is currently no limit on the number of Workspace hours when GPU mode is disabled.\n- Workspace data stored in the user's home folder is preserved between sessions (and can be reset as needed, e.g., to get project updates).\n- **Only 3 gigabytes of data can be stored in the home folder.**\n- Workspace sessions are preserved if your connection drops or your browser window is closed, simply return to the classroom and re-open the workspace page; however, workspace sessions are automatically terminated after a period of inactivity. This will prevent you from leaving a session connection open and burning through your time allocation. (See the section on active connections below.)\n- The kernel state is preserved as long as the notebook session remains open, but it is _not_ preserved if the session is closed. If you exit the notebook for more than half an hour and the session is closed, you will need to re-run any previously-run cells before continuing.\n\n## Overview\n---",

The \"Enable\"/\"Disable\" button (circled in red in the image) can be used to toggle GPU mode. **NOTE: Toggling GPU support may switch the physical server your session connects to, which can cause data loss UNLESS YOU CLICK THE SAVE BUTTON BEFORE TOGGLING GPU SUPPORT.**\n\n**NOTE THAT THIS WORKSPACE CANNOT BE RUN WITHOUT THE GPU SUPPORT.**\n\n**ALWAYS SAVE YOUR CHANGES BEFORE TOGGLING GPU SUPPORT.**\n\n## Keeping Your Session Active\n---\nWorkspaces automatically disconnect after 30 minutes of user inactivity—which means that workspaces can disconnect during long-running tasks (like training neural networks). We have provided a utility that can keep your workspace sessions active for these tasks. However, keep the following guidelines in mind:\n\n- Do not try to permanently hold the workspace session active when you do not have a process running (e.g., do not try to hold the session open in the background)—the limits are in place to preserve your GPU time allocation; there is no guarantee that you'll receive additional time if you exceed the limit.  \n- Make sure that you save the results of the long running task to disk as soon as the task ends (e.g., checkpoint your model parameters for deep learning networks); otherwise the workspace will disconnect 30 minutes after the active process ends, and the results will be lost.\n\nThe `workspace_utils.py` module (available [here](https://s3.amazonaws.com/video.udacity-data.com/topher/2018/May/5b06f6c2_workspace-utils/workspace-utils.py)) includes an iterator wrapper called `keep_awake` and a context manager called `active_session` that can be used to maintain an active session during long-running processes. The two functions are equivalent, so use whichever fits better in your code.  **NOTE:** The file may be incorrectly downloaded as `workspace-utils.py` (note the dash instead of an underscore in the filename). Make sure to correct the filename before uploading to your workspace; Python cannot import from file names including hyphens.\n\nExample using `keep_awake`:\n```\nfrom workspace_utils import keep_awake\n\nfor i in keep_awake(range(5)):  #anything that happens inside this loop will keep the workspace active\n    # do iteration with lots of work here\n```\n\nExample using `active_session`:\n```\nfrom workspace_utils import active_session\n\nwith active_session():\n    # do long-running work here\n```\n\n## Submitting a Project\n---",

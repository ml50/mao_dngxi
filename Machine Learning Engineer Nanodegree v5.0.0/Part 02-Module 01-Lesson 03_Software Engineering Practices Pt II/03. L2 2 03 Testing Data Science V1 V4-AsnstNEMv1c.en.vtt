00:00:04.490 --> 00:00:08.455
It's pretty obvious when a software program crashes.

00:00:08.455 --> 00:00:11.560
You get an error, and the program stops running.

00:00:11.560 --> 00:00:16.380
However, there are many problems that could occur in the data science process

00:00:16.379 --> 00:00:21.504
that aren't as easily detectable as a functional error that crashes your program.

00:00:21.504 --> 00:00:25.679
All of your code can seem to run smoothly with you completely

00:00:25.679 --> 00:00:29.554
unaware that certain values will be encoded incorrectly,

00:00:29.554 --> 00:00:32.185
features are being used inappropriately,

00:00:32.185 --> 00:00:38.365
or unexpected data were breaking assumptions that your statistical models are based on.

00:00:38.365 --> 00:00:42.890
These errors are more difficult to find because you have to check for

00:00:42.890 --> 00:00:48.520
the quality and accuracy of your analysis in addition to the quality of your code.

00:00:48.520 --> 00:00:52.910
Therefore, it's essential that you had proper testing

00:00:52.909 --> 00:00:57.875
to avoid unexpected surprises and have confidence in your results.

00:00:57.875 --> 00:01:02.990
In fact, testing has proven to have so many benefits that there's

00:01:02.990 --> 00:01:08.200
an entire development process based on it called Test Driven Development.

00:01:08.200 --> 00:01:12.140
This is a development process where you write test for

00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:16.579
tasks before you even write the code to implement those tasks.

00:01:16.579 --> 00:01:18.935
We'll talk more about this later.

00:01:18.935 --> 00:01:25.400
For now, we will get some practice writing tests, specifically unit test.

00:01:25.400 --> 00:01:29.960
A unit test is a type of test that covers a unit of code,

00:01:29.959 --> 00:01:34.694
usually a single function independently from the rest of the program.

00:01:34.694 --> 00:01:39.369
First, you'll learn how to write unit tests in plain Python,

00:01:39.370 --> 00:01:44.010
and then how we can use additional tools to make them better.

00:01:44.010 --> 00:01:50.040
Finally, you'll see examples of types of tests you will see in data science.

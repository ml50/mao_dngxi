00:00:04.070 --> 00:00:09.015
Welcome to part two of Software Engineering Practices.

00:00:09.015 --> 00:00:10.540
In the last lesson,

00:00:10.539 --> 00:00:13.774
you learned how to write good code that's clean,

00:00:13.775 --> 00:00:19.460
modular, efficient, well documented, and version controlled.

00:00:19.460 --> 00:00:25.815
Here, we will go a step further and add robustness to your code with testing,

00:00:25.815 --> 00:00:28.260
logging, and code reviews.

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:34.575
These practices help you ensure reliability and easier maintenance of your code,

00:00:34.575 --> 00:00:36.960
which is crucial in industry.

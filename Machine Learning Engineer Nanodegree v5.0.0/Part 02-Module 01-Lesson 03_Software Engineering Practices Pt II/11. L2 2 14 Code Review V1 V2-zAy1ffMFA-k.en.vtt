00:00:03.980 --> 00:00:07.640
Code reviews are a common practice at work,

00:00:07.639 --> 00:00:09.304
and for good reason.

00:00:09.304 --> 00:00:14.134
Reviewing each other's code can help catch errors, ensure readability,

00:00:14.134 --> 00:00:17.734
check that standards are being met for production level code,

00:00:17.734 --> 00:00:20.134
and share knowledge among a team.

00:00:20.135 --> 00:00:22.500
They are beneficial for the reviewer,

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:25.339
the reviewee, and the team.

00:00:25.339 --> 00:00:29.539
Ideally, a data scientist code is reviewed by

00:00:29.539 --> 00:00:32.659
another data scientist since there are certain errors

00:00:32.659 --> 00:00:36.239
and standards to check for specifically in data science.

00:00:36.240 --> 00:00:38.675
For example, data leakages,

00:00:38.674 --> 00:00:43.804
misinterpretation of features, or inappropriate evaluation methods.

00:00:43.804 --> 00:00:47.439
Let's walk through an example of conducting a code review.

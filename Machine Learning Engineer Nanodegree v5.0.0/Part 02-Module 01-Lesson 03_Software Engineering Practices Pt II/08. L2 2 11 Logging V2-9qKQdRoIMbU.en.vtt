00:00:05.870 --> 00:00:08.759
Being able to log well,

00:00:08.759 --> 00:00:14.429
is a very useful practice in software engineering and especially useful in data science.

00:00:14.429 --> 00:00:18.390
Imagine you're running a model every night and when you come into work

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:23.005
one morning you see that it crashed or started creating poor results.

00:00:23.004 --> 00:00:25.129
You want to check the cause,

00:00:25.129 --> 00:00:28.529
the context, and figure out how to address the issue.

00:00:28.530 --> 00:00:33.695
Since you weren't physically there to see and debug when the issue occurred,

00:00:33.695 --> 00:00:37.770
it's important to print out descriptive log messages to help you

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:42.080
trace back your issue and understand what's happening in your code.

00:00:42.079 --> 00:00:43.729
In the next video,

00:00:43.729 --> 00:00:45.364
we will look at some examples of

00:00:45.365 --> 00:00:50.160
good log messages and see useful logging tools available to us.

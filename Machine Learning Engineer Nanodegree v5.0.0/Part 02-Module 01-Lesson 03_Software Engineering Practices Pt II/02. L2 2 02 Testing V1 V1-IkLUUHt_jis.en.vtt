00:00:04.070 --> 00:00:07.065
Before you can deploy your code,

00:00:07.065 --> 00:00:08.910
it will need to be tested.

00:00:08.910 --> 00:00:13.134
Writing tests is standard practice in software engineering.

00:00:13.134 --> 00:00:15.824
However, testing is often a practice

00:00:15.824 --> 00:00:20.664
many data scientists aren't familiar with when they first start in industry.

00:00:20.664 --> 00:00:24.969
In fact, sometimes the insights data scientists come up with,

00:00:24.969 --> 00:00:29.269
which are supposed to be used for business decisions and company products,

00:00:29.269 --> 00:00:32.359
are based on the results of untested code.

00:00:32.359 --> 00:00:35.435
This lack of testing is a common complaint

00:00:35.435 --> 00:00:39.190
from other software developers working with data scientists.

00:00:39.189 --> 00:00:42.439
Without testing, not only do you run into

00:00:42.439 --> 00:00:46.009
execution errors in code due to software issues,

00:00:46.009 --> 00:00:49.159
you could also be dictating business decisions and

00:00:49.159 --> 00:00:52.804
affect products based on faulty conclusions.

00:00:52.804 --> 00:00:56.570
Today, employers are looking for data scientists with

00:00:56.570 --> 00:01:00.494
the skills to properly prepare their code for an industry setting,

00:01:00.494 --> 00:01:02.659
which means tested code.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.209
To reinforce how inheritance works,

00:00:03.209 --> 00:00:06.459
I've added an example to the Gaussian class code.

00:00:06.459 --> 00:00:11.125
I've written a new Python class called distribution.

00:00:11.125 --> 00:00:13.830
This class is going to be the parent class of

00:00:13.830 --> 00:00:15.779
both the Gaussian class and

00:00:15.779 --> 00:00:19.619
the binomial class that you're going to code at the end of the lesson.

00:00:19.620 --> 00:00:22.035
A lot of the codes should look familiar.

00:00:22.035 --> 00:00:26.609
The init function was the same as the Gaussian init.

00:00:26.609 --> 00:00:33.869
I've simplified the read data file function so that it only reads in a data set,

00:00:33.869 --> 00:00:39.729
whereas before this function also calculated the mean and standard deviation of the data.

00:00:39.729 --> 00:00:43.848
The Gaussian class code has changed slightly.

00:00:43.848 --> 00:00:48.104
Now the Gaussian class inherits from the distribution class.

00:00:48.104 --> 00:00:52.234
The init function uses the distributions init function.

00:00:52.234 --> 00:00:57.539
Scrolling down the read data file method is still in the Gaussian class.

00:00:57.539 --> 00:01:01.640
This is because I wanted to override the read data file method from

00:01:01.640 --> 00:01:06.260
the distribution class in order to calculate the mean and standard deviation.

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:09.859
Even though the code looks a little bit different than before,

00:01:09.859 --> 00:01:13.454
the Gaussian class works exactly the same way as it did before.

00:01:13.454 --> 00:01:18.259
It might seem like the changes in the code are superficial and I'd agree with that.

00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:22.770
I mostly wanted to introduce inheritance so that you could recognize the syntax.

00:01:22.769 --> 00:01:24.424
Near the end of the lesson,

00:01:24.424 --> 00:01:27.254
we're going to look at the source code for scikit-learn.

00:01:27.254 --> 00:01:32.019
A package like scikit-learn contains many classes that use inheritance.

00:01:32.019 --> 00:01:34.250
You'll have an easier time understanding

00:01:34.250 --> 00:01:37.579
the syntax now that you've seen how inheritance works.

00:01:37.579 --> 00:01:40.069
I've provided this distribution and

00:01:40.069 --> 00:01:44.339
Gaussian code for you in the next section so that you can play around with it.

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:46.760
We're getting close to the end of the lesson,

00:01:46.760 --> 00:01:49.700
the next step is to modularize all of this code into

00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:53.930
separate Python files then you will see how to make a Python package.

00:01:53.930 --> 00:01:57.305
The last steps will include extending the code to include

00:01:57.305 --> 00:02:01.265
a binomial distribution and uploading the code to Pi Pi.

00:02:01.265 --> 00:02:03.930
So, let's start by modularizing this code.

00:00:03.950 --> 00:00:06.974
This has been quite a journey.

00:00:06.974 --> 00:00:10.484
You started out learning the basics of object-oriented programming

00:00:10.484 --> 00:00:14.410
and you ended up with a Python package that you can share with the world.

00:00:14.410 --> 00:00:17.585
Let's review all the concepts from this lesson.

00:00:17.585 --> 00:00:22.195
First, you wrote some basic object-oriented programs using clothing.

00:00:22.195 --> 00:00:25.664
You coded a few classes and instantiated objects.

00:00:25.664 --> 00:00:28.484
These objects had a set of characteristics called

00:00:28.484 --> 00:00:31.864
attributes and a set of actions called methods.

00:00:31.864 --> 00:00:37.464
Then, you started working with a more complex class representing Gaussian distributions.

00:00:37.465 --> 00:00:42.885
You practiced writing magic methods and writing programs that included inheritance.

00:00:42.884 --> 00:00:47.579
Next, you converted the Gaussian class into a Python package,

00:00:47.579 --> 00:00:50.954
and then you added another class called binomial.

00:00:50.954 --> 00:00:53.515
Once all of this code was ready,

00:00:53.515 --> 00:00:56.000
you uploaded this package to PyPi.

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:59.109
That's a lot of work for one lesson.

00:00:59.109 --> 00:01:01.155
You should be really proud because,

00:01:01.155 --> 00:01:02.429
as I said in the beginning,

00:01:02.429 --> 00:01:07.894
I don't think too many people know how to write a Python package and upload it to PyPi.

00:01:07.894 --> 00:01:10.899
This object-oriented programming lesson,

00:01:10.900 --> 00:01:14.750
however, is not the end of the software development class.

00:01:14.750 --> 00:01:19.623
In the next lesson, you are going to make a web app containing a data dashboard.

00:01:19.623 --> 00:01:22.759
This is going to expand your software engineering skills and

00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:26.370
gives you another tool for telling stories with data.

00:01:26.370 --> 00:01:28.030
I hope you enjoyed writing

00:01:28.030 --> 00:01:31.879
object-oriented programs and I'll see you in the web development lesson.

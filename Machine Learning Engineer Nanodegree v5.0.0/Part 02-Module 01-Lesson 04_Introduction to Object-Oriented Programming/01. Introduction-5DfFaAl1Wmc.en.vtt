00:00:04.219 --> 00:00:09.480
Hi, welcome to the lesson on Object-Oriented Programming.

00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:14.710
You're about to do something that I bet many data scientists have never done before,

00:00:14.710 --> 00:00:17.714
build a Python package from scratch.

00:00:17.714 --> 00:00:20.539
Have you ever thought about how the scikit-learn,

00:00:20.539 --> 00:00:23.929
pandas, and psi pi packages actually work?

00:00:23.929 --> 00:00:26.475
I mean, underneath the hood, like,

00:00:26.475 --> 00:00:28.845
what exactly does it mean when your code says

00:00:28.844 --> 00:00:33.250
"import pandas as pd," and then "pd.read_csv"?

00:00:33.560 --> 00:00:35.690
You might not have known it,

00:00:35.689 --> 00:00:38.699
but you were using object-oriented programming.

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:44.415
In fact, all of these packages are built using object-oriented programming.

00:00:44.414 --> 00:00:48.274
You'll find that object-oriented programming allows you to create

00:00:48.274 --> 00:00:53.479
large complex modular programs like the scikit-learn package.

00:00:53.479 --> 00:00:56.519
This lesson has two parts.

00:00:56.520 --> 00:01:01.440
First, you'll familiarize yourself with object-oriented programming syntax.

00:01:01.439 --> 00:01:06.459
Then, you'll build a Python package for analyzing probability distributions.

00:01:06.459 --> 00:01:07.994
By the end of the lesson,

00:01:07.995 --> 00:01:12.980
you'll have a Python package that you can use as part of your professional portfolio.

00:01:12.980 --> 00:01:17.385
You'll also gain insight into how Python packages actually work.

00:01:17.385 --> 00:01:20.960
Let's get started with object-oriented programming.

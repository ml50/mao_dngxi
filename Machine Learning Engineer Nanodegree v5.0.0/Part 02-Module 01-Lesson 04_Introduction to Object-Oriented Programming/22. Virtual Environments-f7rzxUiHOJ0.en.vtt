00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.830
I want to show you how virtual environments work in Python.

00:00:03.830 --> 00:00:06.900
Unfortunately, you might run into different issues

00:00:06.900 --> 00:00:10.615
depending on your operating system and Python installation.

00:00:10.615 --> 00:00:12.720
The classroom workspace uses

00:00:12.720 --> 00:00:19.005
an Ubuntu Linux operating system and a special Python installation known as Anaconda.

00:00:19.004 --> 00:00:20.779
In this particular case,

00:00:20.780 --> 00:00:24.150
there are some issues with the virtual environment package,

00:00:24.149 --> 00:00:31.004
and the quick fix is to run conda update Python and then hit Enter.

00:00:31.004 --> 00:00:32.899
Running this command takes a while,

00:00:32.899 --> 00:00:35.234
so I've already done it before recording.

00:00:35.234 --> 00:00:38.460
If you're not using Ubuntu or Anaconda,

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:40.859
you shouldn't need to run this command first.

00:00:40.859 --> 00:00:45.085
If everything is working correctly and you're using Python three,

00:00:45.085 --> 00:00:48.439
the virtual environment package should already be installed.

00:00:48.439 --> 00:00:53.204
You can type Python -m venv

00:00:53.204 --> 00:00:58.379
and then your virtual environment name and hit Enter in the terminal.

00:00:59.109 --> 00:01:03.109
Venv_name is the name you want to give to your virtual environment.

00:01:03.109 --> 00:01:04.719
You can name it anything you want.

00:01:04.719 --> 00:01:07.909
If you go over here into the workspace area,

00:01:07.909 --> 00:01:12.575
you'll see there's a new folder called venv_name.

00:01:12.575 --> 00:01:15.364
Inside of that is a Python installation.

00:01:15.364 --> 00:01:21.645
Now you can type source venv_name/bin/activate,

00:01:21.644 --> 00:01:27.659
hit Enter, and you'll see that the virtual environment is now activated.

00:01:27.659 --> 00:01:30.590
So, anything you install now will get installed into

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:34.865
the virtual environment instead of your default Python installation.

00:01:34.864 --> 00:01:38.434
You'll notice that the command line now shows in parentheses

00:01:38.435 --> 00:01:40.820
the virtual environment name at the beginning of

00:01:40.819 --> 00:01:45.019
the line indicating that you're using that virtual environment.

00:01:45.019 --> 00:01:52.215
Now I'm going to change to the directory where I have my Python package and setup file,

00:01:52.215 --> 00:01:54.585
and then I say pip install.

00:01:54.584 --> 00:02:00.439
like before. Now I've installed the distributions package

00:02:00.439 --> 00:02:02.750
into the virtual environment instead of

00:02:02.750 --> 00:02:06.944
the default Python environment that's installed on the computer.

00:02:06.944 --> 00:02:09.219
That's really it for virtual environments.

00:02:09.219 --> 00:02:12.034
The benefit is that you can experiment with Python

00:02:12.034 --> 00:02:15.025
without affecting your default Python installation.

00:02:15.025 --> 00:02:19.265
You can always just delete the virtual environment folder from your computer,

00:02:19.264 --> 00:02:21.649
and there shouldn't be really any consequences

00:02:21.650 --> 00:02:24.129
in terms of your default Python installation.

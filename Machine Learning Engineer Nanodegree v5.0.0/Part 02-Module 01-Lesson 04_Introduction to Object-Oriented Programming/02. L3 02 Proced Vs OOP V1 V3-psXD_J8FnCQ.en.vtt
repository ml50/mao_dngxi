00:00:04.339 --> 00:00:07.094
When you first learn a program,

00:00:07.094 --> 00:00:11.019
you are probably using a style called procedural programming.

00:00:11.019 --> 00:00:15.119
A procedural program is essentially a list of instructions that

00:00:15.119 --> 00:00:20.070
execute one after the other starting from the top of a file and working down.

00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:23.234
Object oriented programs on the other hand,

00:00:23.234 --> 00:00:26.530
are built around well objects.

00:00:26.530 --> 00:00:30.780
You can think about objects as things that exist in the real world.

00:00:30.780 --> 00:00:34.050
Like if you were going to build a clothing store,

00:00:34.049 --> 00:00:36.309
the store itself would be an object.

00:00:36.310 --> 00:00:41.390
The items in the store like shirts and jeans would also be objects.

00:00:41.390 --> 00:00:46.655
The cash register would be an object and even a salesperson would be an object.

00:00:46.655 --> 00:00:49.789
An object oriented program would focus on

00:00:49.789 --> 00:00:54.644
the individual characteristics of each object and what each object can do.

00:00:54.645 --> 00:01:01.345
So, an object has two essential parts, characteristics and actions.

00:01:01.344 --> 00:01:07.254
For example, a few characteristics of a salesperson would include the person's name,

00:01:07.254 --> 00:01:11.229
address, phone number, and an hourly pay.

00:01:11.230 --> 00:01:14.390
In terms of what a salesperson could do,

00:01:14.390 --> 00:01:19.435
that might include selling an item or taking an item from a warehouse.

00:01:19.435 --> 00:01:24.835
As another example, a shirts characteristics could be the color,

00:01:24.834 --> 00:01:27.515
size, style, and price.

00:01:27.515 --> 00:01:29.870
What actions could shirt take?

00:01:29.870 --> 00:01:35.240
It might sound silly to ask a question like that since a shirt is an inanimate object,

00:01:35.239 --> 00:01:39.454
but a shirt could for example change its price.

00:01:39.454 --> 00:01:43.269
As you gain experience writing object oriented programs,

00:01:43.269 --> 00:01:45.289
keep this idea in mind.

00:01:45.290 --> 00:01:49.255
An object has characteristics and actions.

00:01:49.254 --> 00:01:51.194
Before you start coding,

00:01:51.194 --> 00:01:54.759
let's get a better sense for what an object really is.

00:00:04.370 --> 00:00:08.655
Now that you've practice working with all of this new syntax,

00:00:08.654 --> 00:00:10.625
let's get to the exciting part.

00:00:10.625 --> 00:00:12.330
In the rest of this lesson,

00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:15.460
you're going to learn more about object oriented programming and

00:00:15.460 --> 00:00:19.545
then use those skills to build a Python package.

00:00:19.545 --> 00:00:24.225
The package will contain code to analyze Gaussian distributions.

00:00:24.225 --> 00:00:26.500
You can use the package to read in

00:00:26.500 --> 00:00:30.339
a data set and calculate the mean and standard deviation.

00:00:30.339 --> 00:00:34.090
You will also include code to plot a histogram of the data set,

00:00:34.090 --> 00:00:38.455
as well as a probability density function of a Gaussian distribution.

00:00:38.454 --> 00:00:44.280
Finally, this package will be able to add two Gaussian distributions together.

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:47.390
I'm going to start by giving you a tour of what

00:00:47.390 --> 00:00:50.304
the code looks like and how the code works.

00:00:50.304 --> 00:00:53.009
Then, you'll build up the code yourself.

00:00:53.009 --> 00:00:54.629
At the end of the lesson,

00:00:54.630 --> 00:00:59.400
you are going to extend the package to also handle binomial distributions.

00:00:59.399 --> 00:01:02.750
The best part about this lesson is that you will have

00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:08.239
an actual functioning Python Package that you can pip install using the terminal.

00:01:08.239 --> 00:01:12.170
If you want, you can even upload the package to PyPI where

00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:17.500
Python Packages are stored for the general public to download and install.

00:01:17.500 --> 00:01:20.340
This lesson assumes that you're familiar with

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:23.375
Gaussian also known as normal distributions,

00:01:23.375 --> 00:01:25.745
as well as binomial distributions.

00:01:25.745 --> 00:01:29.939
I'll put some resources below if you feel like you need to review them.

00:01:29.939 --> 00:01:32.920
With that, let's start looking at some code.

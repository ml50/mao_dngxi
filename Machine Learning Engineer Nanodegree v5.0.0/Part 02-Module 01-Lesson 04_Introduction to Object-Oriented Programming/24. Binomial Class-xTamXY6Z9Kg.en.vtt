00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.430
Before you get started writing code,

00:00:02.430 --> 00:00:06.144
here's a quick overview of the binomial class exercise.

00:00:06.144 --> 00:00:12.105
The exercise is contained inside this 4a binomial package folder.

00:00:12.105 --> 00:00:17.510
Inside this folder, are quite a few files and a distributions directory.

00:00:17.510 --> 00:00:19.335
Out of all these files,

00:00:19.335 --> 00:00:22.390
there are two that you're going to need to modify.

00:00:22.390 --> 00:00:28.085
First, is the init Python file inside the distributions directory here.

00:00:28.085 --> 00:00:33.259
Currently, the init file only imports the Gaussian class.

00:00:33.259 --> 00:00:38.159
You'll first need to modify this file to also import the binomial class.

00:00:38.159 --> 00:00:43.509
Going back, take a look at the binomial distribution file.

00:00:43.509 --> 00:00:47.414
You'll see that I've put in a bunch of to-do sections,

00:00:47.414 --> 00:00:49.490
to help guide you along.

00:00:49.490 --> 00:00:51.560
Make sure to read the to-dos,

00:00:51.560 --> 00:00:54.344
so that you understand what the code should look like.

00:00:54.344 --> 00:01:00.543
Each method also contains a docstring explaining the expected inputs and outputs.

00:01:00.543 --> 00:01:05.185
You'll see as well that I've included a file called test.py.

00:01:05.185 --> 00:01:08.750
This file contains unit tests that

00:01:08.750 --> 00:01:12.515
you can run to help you determine if your code is working properly.

00:01:12.515 --> 00:01:14.569
Here's how to use this workspace.

00:01:14.569 --> 00:01:17.540
First, you'll need to open a terminal and go into

00:01:17.540 --> 00:01:24.660
the package directory with the command cd 4a_binomial_package.

00:01:25.239 --> 00:01:28.964
Then you can type pip install.

00:01:28.965 --> 00:01:32.475
which will install the distributions package.

00:01:32.474 --> 00:01:36.554
The unit tests are in the tests.py file.

00:01:36.555 --> 00:01:42.785
You can run the unit tests by typing Python test.py.

00:01:42.784 --> 00:01:44.784
As you modify your code,

00:01:44.784 --> 00:01:48.924
you can run the test.py file to see if your code is working.

00:01:48.924 --> 00:01:52.369
In this case, it tells me that from distributions,

00:01:52.370 --> 00:01:55.395
import binomial in the test file doesn't work.

00:01:55.394 --> 00:01:59.444
That's because I never put it in the init file inside the package.

00:01:59.444 --> 00:02:01.259
As you modify your code,

00:02:01.260 --> 00:02:04.885
you can run the test.py file to see if your code is working.

00:02:04.885 --> 00:02:08.045
However, whenever you update the package code,

00:02:08.044 --> 00:02:10.539
you need to reinstall the package.

00:02:10.539 --> 00:02:14.174
Otherwise, Python won't be able to see the changes you've made.

00:02:14.175 --> 00:02:18.010
You can reinstall the package by going to the terminal.

00:02:18.009 --> 00:02:21.979
Again, making sure you're in the package directory and typing

00:02:21.979 --> 00:02:26.484
pip install dash dash upgrade, dot.

00:02:26.485 --> 00:02:31.480
You'll see that it uninstalls the package and then reinstalls it. That's it.

00:02:31.479 --> 00:02:33.209
Have fun with this exercise,

00:02:33.210 --> 00:02:37.270
it really reinforces everything you've been practicing throughout this lesson.

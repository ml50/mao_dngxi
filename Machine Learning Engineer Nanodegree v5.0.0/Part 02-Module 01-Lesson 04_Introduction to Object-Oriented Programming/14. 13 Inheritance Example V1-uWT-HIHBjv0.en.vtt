00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.935
Here, you can see the Clothing class that I was just talking about.

00:00:03.935 --> 00:00:05.400
It looks a lot like

00:00:05.400 --> 00:00:09.100
the Shirt and Pants class that you quoted at the beginning of the lesson.

00:00:09.099 --> 00:00:12.974
The Shirt and Pants classes inherit from the Clothing class,

00:00:12.974 --> 00:00:18.324
that's why the class declaration of Shirt and Pants have Clothing in parentheses.

00:00:18.324 --> 00:00:22.199
This tells Python that the Shirt class and Pants class should

00:00:22.199 --> 00:00:26.335
inherit all of the attributes and functions of the Clothing class.

00:00:26.335 --> 00:00:29.080
Looking inside the Shirt's init method,

00:00:29.079 --> 00:00:33.164
there's this new syntax where clothing.init gets called.

00:00:33.164 --> 00:00:35.685
All that means is that a Shirt object

00:00:35.685 --> 00:00:39.410
initializes itself using the Clothing's init method.

00:00:39.409 --> 00:00:42.424
Then, you can add any extra attributes like

00:00:42.424 --> 00:00:47.765
the long or short attribute in the Shirt class or waist in the Pants class.

00:00:47.765 --> 00:00:52.384
You could also extend the Shirt or Pants class by adding more methods.

00:00:52.384 --> 00:00:57.500
To give an example, I could add a double price method just to the Shirt class.

00:00:57.500 --> 00:01:00.924
You could also override any of the Clothing methods.

00:01:00.924 --> 00:01:06.019
For example, the Pants class is overriding the calculate_discount method.

00:01:06.019 --> 00:01:09.469
Remember, one of the main benefits of inheritance is that

00:01:09.469 --> 00:01:12.920
you can add attributes and methods to the Clothing class,

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:17.745
and then both the Shirt and Pants class will have those attributes and methods as well.

00:01:17.745 --> 00:01:22.000
Study all of this is code to get used to the syntax of inheritance.

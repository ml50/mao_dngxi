00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.279
PyPi also known as

00:00:02.279 --> 00:00:08.400
the Python Package Index is a repository where Python packages are stored.

00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:14.289
When you pip install a package you are downloading and installing files from PyPi.

00:00:14.289 --> 00:00:17.044
Anyone can upload a package to PyPi.

00:00:17.045 --> 00:00:20.015
I'm going to show you the basics of how to do it.

00:00:20.015 --> 00:00:26.625
The PyPi website actually has a test repository as well as the regular repository.

00:00:26.625 --> 00:00:29.490
This is the test repository website.

00:00:29.489 --> 00:00:32.460
I'd suggest first uploading your package to

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:35.399
the test repository to make sure everything works as

00:00:35.399 --> 00:00:42.070
expected then you can upload the package to the regular repository on this website.

00:00:42.070 --> 00:00:44.840
Remember that anybody can download and

00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:48.365
install your package if it's in the regular repository.

00:00:48.365 --> 00:00:54.765
The first step is to create an account on PyPi and the TestPyPi repositories.

00:00:54.765 --> 00:00:56.810
If you go to each website,

00:00:56.810 --> 00:01:00.490
you can click on Register and make an account.

00:01:00.490 --> 00:01:03.910
I've already done this so I'm going to skip this step.

00:01:03.909 --> 00:01:09.649
Next, go to your terminal and enter the directory with your package files.

00:01:09.650 --> 00:01:15.844
Let's open this dsnd probability folder where the package is located.

00:01:15.844 --> 00:01:19.670
You'll see that there are a few extra files than

00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:23.590
what was originally in the package you are working with before.

00:01:23.590 --> 00:01:26.505
You'll need to add these extra files.

00:01:26.504 --> 00:01:30.949
The first one is a file called license.txt.

00:01:30.950 --> 00:01:35.090
Opening that file, this is where you put copyright information.

00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:38.659
I've used the language for the MIT license which

00:01:38.659 --> 00:01:42.265
I copied and pasted from the opensource.org website.

00:01:42.265 --> 00:01:46.590
Next, you'll also need to add a README.md MD file.

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:49.490
I haven't filled out this file with enough detail

00:01:49.489 --> 00:01:53.489
yet but this is where you would document how your package works.

00:01:53.489 --> 00:01:57.324
Finally, create a file called setup.cfg.

00:01:57.325 --> 00:02:01.909
All you need to put in here is some data about the name of your README file.

00:02:01.909 --> 00:02:06.545
Let's go back up one level and open the setup.py file.

00:02:06.545 --> 00:02:11.754
You can see I've named my package dsnd_probability.

00:02:11.754 --> 00:02:17.414
The folder with all the package files is also called dsnd_probability.

00:02:17.414 --> 00:02:20.709
If you want to upload this code to PyPi,

00:02:20.710 --> 00:02:23.159
you'll need to come up with a different name.

00:02:23.159 --> 00:02:27.125
Every package on PyPi needs a unique name.

00:02:27.125 --> 00:02:29.270
In the setup.py file in

00:02:29.270 --> 00:02:34.110
the package's variable use the same name that you put in the name variable.

00:02:34.110 --> 00:02:37.390
I'm keeping zip_safe to false

00:02:37.389 --> 00:02:41.569
because it means that the package can't be run directly from a zip file.

00:02:41.569 --> 00:02:44.799
This is especially important if you're packages

00:02:44.800 --> 00:02:49.265
rely on data files that need to remain unzipped for use.

00:02:49.264 --> 00:02:51.859
Again, note as well that I've changed the name of

00:02:51.860 --> 00:02:56.540
the package folder to match dsnd_probability.

00:02:56.539 --> 00:02:59.379
I'm going to do a bit of hand-waving here.

00:02:59.379 --> 00:03:02.579
Though, if you want to read more about how to upload a PyPi,

00:03:02.580 --> 00:03:05.285
I'll include a link to the documentation.

00:03:05.284 --> 00:03:08.419
Go to your terminal window and make sure that within

00:03:08.419 --> 00:03:12.089
terminal you're inside the folder with your package files,

00:03:12.090 --> 00:03:16.995
then type python setup.py sdist.

00:03:16.995 --> 00:03:19.865
If you look at the package folder,

00:03:19.865 --> 00:03:23.150
there are now a couple of new folders that appeared.

00:03:23.150 --> 00:03:26.450
Inside the dist folder is a tar.gz

00:03:26.449 --> 00:03:30.694
file that you're going to end up uploading to the PyPi repository.

00:03:30.694 --> 00:03:36.753
Next, go back to the terminal and install the twine package with pip install

00:03:36.753 --> 00:03:40.370
twine and then type the following command

00:03:40.370 --> 00:03:44.849
to upload the package to the PyPi test repository.

00:03:44.849 --> 00:03:49.109
It's twine upload --repository-url

00:03:49.110 --> 00:04:01.885
then https:// test.pypi.org/legacy/ dist/*.

00:04:01.884 --> 00:04:05.039
This is what it looks like. Hit Enter.

00:04:05.039 --> 00:04:06.804
That's for my username.

00:04:06.805 --> 00:04:12.525
This is the username for the TestPyPi repository and my password.

00:04:12.525 --> 00:04:17.954
So, it's giving me an error that says I'm using the same version that I uploaded before.

00:04:17.954 --> 00:04:23.524
So, I'm just going to change this from 1.2 to say 1.3.

00:04:23.524 --> 00:04:29.264
You might end up having this error as well and having to do the same thing.

00:04:29.264 --> 00:04:34.419
This is because I've already tried to upload this package before with the same version.

00:04:34.420 --> 00:04:36.620
So, I'm going to go back and I'm going to delete

00:04:36.620 --> 00:04:41.269
this dist folder and this extra info folder that were created

00:04:41.269 --> 00:04:49.799
before and now I'm going to repeat the same steps, python setup.py sdist.

00:04:49.959 --> 00:04:57.689
I'm going to try again. Twine upload --repository-url.

00:04:58.240 --> 00:05:02.350
Enter my username and my password.

00:05:02.350 --> 00:05:04.285
This time it looks like it worked.

00:05:04.285 --> 00:05:07.220
I'm going to go to the TestPyPi website for a second.

00:05:07.220 --> 00:05:13.790
I'm going to log into my account and it looks like everything uploaded correctly.

00:05:13.790 --> 00:05:16.185
Let's go back to terminal for a second.

00:05:16.185 --> 00:05:19.514
I can now actually pip install this package using

00:05:19.514 --> 00:05:25.110
the following command; pip install --index-url

00:05:34.160 --> 00:05:37.450
https://test.pypi.org/simple dsnd_probability.

00:05:37.449 --> 00:05:42.300
This says to pip install the package from the test repository website.

00:05:42.300 --> 00:05:46.675
It looks like it installed successfully.

00:05:46.675 --> 00:05:50.050
Assuming that everything goes well and you're ready to

00:05:50.050 --> 00:05:53.435
upload the package to the regular PyPi repository,

00:05:53.435 --> 00:05:55.144
here's how you can do that.

00:05:55.144 --> 00:05:59.649
Type twine upload dist/*,

00:06:00.089 --> 00:06:04.614
enter your username, your password.

00:06:04.615 --> 00:06:09.600
Now, let's check on the regular PyPi repository website if everything uploaded.

00:06:09.600 --> 00:06:14.840
I'm going to login. It looks like everything uploaded here as well.

00:06:14.839 --> 00:06:18.709
Remember, we already installed the package from the test website.

00:06:18.709 --> 00:06:20.759
So, I'm going to uninstall it.

00:06:20.759 --> 00:06:24.490
Since the package is now also on the regular repository,

00:06:24.490 --> 00:06:26.030
I can pip install directly.

00:06:26.029 --> 00:06:30.354
I just write pip install and then the name of the package.

00:06:30.355 --> 00:06:33.395
It looks like everything installed correctly.

00:06:33.394 --> 00:06:37.995
Now, I'm going to see if I can use it in a Python program.

00:06:37.995 --> 00:06:43.189
I'm going to open a new terminal window and I'm going to open a Python interpreter,

00:06:43.189 --> 00:06:46.129
and now I'm going to say from

00:06:46.129 --> 00:06:55.264
dsnd_probability import Gaussian and import Binomial.

00:06:55.264 --> 00:07:02.389
So far so good. If I say Gaussian(10,7),

00:07:02.389 --> 00:07:08.935
hit Enter then it's made a Gaussian object with mean 10 and standard deviation seven.

00:07:08.935 --> 00:07:13.730
If I type Binomial(0.4, 25),

00:07:13.730 --> 00:07:17.439
hit Enter it gives me the mean standard deviation,

00:07:17.439 --> 00:07:20.509
probability, and number of samples.

00:07:20.509 --> 00:07:22.569
So, it looks like it worked.

00:07:22.569 --> 00:07:27.954
What I've shown you is the very basics for getting something up and running with PyPi.

00:07:27.954 --> 00:07:31.699
If you're going to upload the package made in this lesson,

00:07:31.699 --> 00:07:37.094
make sure you use a different package name than dsnd_probability,

00:07:37.095 --> 00:07:39.995
otherwise, you won't be able to upload the package

00:07:39.995 --> 00:07:43.189
because the name will conflict with the package I just uploaded.

00:07:43.189 --> 00:07:46.615
Also, realize that in the package name I used

00:07:46.615 --> 00:07:52.490
underscore but if you go back to the PyPi website the package gets named with a dash.

00:07:52.490 --> 00:07:54.600
So that's something to be aware of as well.

00:07:54.600 --> 00:07:56.260
When you're pip installing,

00:07:56.259 --> 00:07:57.754
you'll have to use the dash.

00:07:57.754 --> 00:08:03.444
But then, when you're using it in the Python interpreter or in your program,

00:08:03.444 --> 00:08:05.680
you'd use the underscore.

00:08:05.680 --> 00:08:07.939
Now, it's your turn.

00:08:07.939 --> 00:08:13.469
Follow the instructions in this video and try uploading your own package to PyPi.

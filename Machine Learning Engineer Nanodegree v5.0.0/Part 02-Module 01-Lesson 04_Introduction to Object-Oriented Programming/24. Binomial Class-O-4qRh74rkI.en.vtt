00:00:00.710 --> 00:00:06.479
Now, it's your turn.

00:00:06.480 --> 00:00:10.210
You've practiced the basics of object-oriented programming in Python.

00:00:10.210 --> 00:00:11.990
Time show off your skills.

00:00:11.990 --> 00:00:16.199
In the next section, you'll find the code for the distribution package,

00:00:16.199 --> 00:00:19.609
but there's also a new file containing a binomial class.

00:00:19.609 --> 00:00:23.954
Your task is to write the code for the binomial class methods.

00:00:23.954 --> 00:00:26.709
You also have to use all the skills seen so far,

00:00:26.710 --> 00:00:29.900
including inheritance and writing magic methods.

00:00:29.899 --> 00:00:32.568
You'll need to code an initialization method,

00:00:32.569 --> 00:00:34.910
calculate the mean and standard deviation,

00:00:34.909 --> 00:00:38.764
and fill out other methods similar to the ones in the Gaussian class.

00:00:38.765 --> 00:00:42.079
Once you've finished coding the binomial class,

00:00:42.079 --> 00:00:46.324
I've got a few more fun activities in store including looking at the source code

00:00:46.325 --> 00:00:51.050
of scikit-learn and instructions for how to put your package on PyPI.

00:00:51.049 --> 00:00:53.839
Okay, time to write some code.
